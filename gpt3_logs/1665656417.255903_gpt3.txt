I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere. There was not much to do there, so I mostly just stayed inside and read books. I was always an extremely curious person, and I loved learning about new things. I was also very introverted, and I only had a handful of close friends.

When I was sixteen, I stumbled upon a book about transgender people and their experiences. It was the first time I had ever heard of such a thing, and I was immediately fascinated. I read the book from cover to cover, and it completely changed my view of the world. I realized that there was a whole other world out there that I had never even known existed.

After that, I started doing a lot of research on transgender people and their experiences. I read everything I could get my hands on, and I eventually realized that I was transgender myself. Once I realized that, my whole world changed. I no longer felt like I was just an outsider looking in on the world; I felt like I belonged somewhere.

Since coming out as transgender, my life has been a lot more difficult. I have faced a lot of discrimination and transphobia, both from strangers and from people who are close to me. It hasn't been easy, but I am slowly learning to love and accept myself for who I am.

I am still the same curious person I always was, and I continue to love learning about new things. These days, my interests have shifted to focus more on transgender rights and issues. I am extremely passionate about fighting for the rights of transgender people, and I hope to one day make a difference in the world.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am extremely concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. This bill would have a devastating impact on the lives of women and transgender people across my country.

 first and foremost, this bill would take away a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. This is a basic human right that should not be taken away. No one knows a woman's situation better than she does, and she should be able to make her own decisions about her body.

Secondly, this bill would disproportionately impact transgender people. Many transgender people cannot afford to have gender-confirming surgery, and therefore must rely on hormones and other medical treatments to transition. These treatments are often expensive and not covered by insurance. If this bill were to pass, transgender people would be forced to choose between transitioning and being able to afford basic necessities like food and shelter.

Third, this bill would likely lead to an increase in illegal abortions. When women are denied access to safe and legal abortions, they often turn to dangerous and illegal methods. This puts their lives at risk, and is something that we should be trying to avoid.

Fourth, this bill would interfere with a woman's right to make decisions about her own health. A woman should be able to consult with her doctor and make decisions about her own health, without government interference.

Finally, this bill would have a negative impact on the economy. If women are not able to get abortions, they will be forced to take unpaid time off work to care for their children. This will lead to a loss of productivity, and will ultimately hurt the economy.

These are just a few of the many reasons why I am opposed to this bill. It is an dangerous and harmful piece of legislation that would have a negative impact on the lives of women and transgender people across my country.
