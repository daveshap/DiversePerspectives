I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere. There was not much to do there, so I mostly just stayed inside and read books. I was always an extremely curious person, and I loved learning about new things. I was also very introverted, and I only had a handful of close friends.

When I was sixteen, I stumbled upon a book about transgender people and their experiences. It was the first time I had ever heard of such a thing, and I was immediately fascinated. I read the book from cover to cover, and it completely changed my view of the world. I realized that there was a whole other world out there that I had never even known existed.

After that, I started doing a lot of research on transgender people and their experiences. I read everything I could get my hands on, and I eventually realized that I was transgender myself. Once I realized that, my whole world changed. I no longer felt like I was just an outsider looking in on the world; I felt like I belonged somewhere.

Since coming out as transgender, my life has been a lot more difficult. I have faced a lot of discrimination and transphobia, both from strangers and from people who are close to me. It hasn't been easy, but I am slowly learning to love and accept myself for who I am.

I am still the same curious person I always was, and I continue to love learning about new things. These days, my interests have shifted to focus more on transgender rights and issues. I am extremely passionate about fighting for the rights of transgender people, and I hope to one day make a difference in the world.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am strongly opposed to this proposed bill. I believe that it is a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body, and I believe that banning all abortions would be a huge step backwards for women's rights.

I believe that every woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body. This is a basic human right that should not be infringed upon. Banning all abortions would take away this right, and it would force women to have children against their will. This is not something that I can support.

I also believe that banning all abortions would be a huge step backwards for women's rights. Women have only recently gained the right to control their own bodies, and banning abortion would be a huge setback. It would deny women the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. This is something that I cannot support.
