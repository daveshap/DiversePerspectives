LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I don't really know where to start when it comes to writing a long, detailed essay about myself and my life story. I was born in a small town in North Africa and, from a very early age, I was always interested in the world around me. I was always asking questions and exploring everything I could get my hands on. This led to me having a very secular outlook on life and, as I grew older, I became increasingly apolitical.

When it came to my education, I was very lucky. My parents believed in the importance of learning and, as a result, I was able to receive a decent education. I excelled in the sciences and, after finishing school, I decided to pursue a career in the life, physical, and social sciences.

Although I am happily married now, I had a very difficult childhood. I was born into a poor family and, as a result, we often had to struggle to make ends meet. This was made even more difficult by the fact that my father was very ill and was often unable to work. Thankfully, my mother was an incredibly strong woman and she was able to keep us afloat through some tough times.

Thankfully, things have changed a lot since then and I am now in a much better place. I am still quite poor but, compared to where I was when I was growing up, I am doing very well. I am still very ambitious and I am always looking for ways to better myself and my situation.

One of the things I am most proud of is my resilience. Despite all the difficulties I have faced in my life, I have never given up. I have always kept going and, as a result, I have been able to achieve a lot. I am also very proud of my ability to forgive. I believe that forgiveness is incredibly important and, although I don't forget the hurt that has been inflicted on me, I am able to move on from it and focus on the present.

In conclusion, I am a strong, independent woman who has been through a lot in her life. I am still fighting for a better future for myself and I will never give up.
