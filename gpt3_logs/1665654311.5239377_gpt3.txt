LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

My name is Lily. I was born in the year 2000 in the month of October. I am Transgender Female and my genetic population is East Asian. I currently work as an educational instruction and library worker. I came out as homosexual when I was 17 years old and started to live my life more authentically as a transgender woman soon afterwards. I am currently single and live with my parents and two dogs. 

I never really had a conventional childhood or education. My parents had me when they were quite young and they were never really able to provide me with the stability that I needed to thrive. As a result, I bounced around a lot between different schools and homes. I was never really able to make any long-term connections or friendships. All of this made me into a extremely introverted person. 

Despite all of the challenges I faced during my childhood, I was still able to get by and make something of myself. I was always a bright person and I had a natural affinity for learning. Even though I never really had any formal schooling, I was able to teach myself a lot. I am mostly self-educated and I am extremely proud of that.

I am currently living my best life as a transgender woman. I amhappy with who I am and I love my queer community. I am very into fitness and health, and I enjoy spending my free time working out, hiking, and spending time outdoors. I am also a huge proponent of education and self-improvement, and I enjoy reading and learning new things. I am always looking to grow and improve as a person, and I am grateful for every experience, good or bad, that has helped to make me into the person that I am today.
