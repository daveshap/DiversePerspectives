LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am an Australian legal professional with a postsecondary education. I am genderqueer and tend to express my gender as male. I identify as homosexual and my religious beliefs are informed by Buddhism. I am a focused and curious person, and I value ambition, introspection, and playfulness. I am also quite critical and tend to be on the pessimistic side. I am conservative in many ways but also quite egalitarian. I am loving and kind, but my childhood was quite difficult. I am young and have only recently started to build a better life for myself.
