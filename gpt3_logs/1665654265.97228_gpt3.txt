LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am someone who is extremely generous. I always try to help others, whether it is through volunteering, donating money, or just simply being there for someone in their time of need. I firmly believe that it is our responsibility to make the world a better place, and I do whatever I can to play my part in making that happen.

I am also someone who is extremely optomistic. I always try to see the best in people, even when they might not deserve it. I firmly believe that everyone has the potential to be good, and that it is our responsibility to brings out the best in others.

I am also mildly secular. I believe that everyone has the right to their own religious beliefs, and that we should all respect each other's right to believe what we want to believe. However, I also believe that religion should not be a force in our society, and that we should all be free to choose our own spiritual path.

I am also extremely pessimstic. I often times find myself waiting for the other shoe to drop, and brace myself for the worst. I have a strong belief that things will often times turn out badly, and that it is our responsibility to be prepared for when they do.

I am also mildly thoughtful. I often times find myself taking the time to really think about things before I make a decision. I believe that it is our responsibility to be thoughtful and considerate in our decision making, and to not just blindly follow along with the crowd.

I am also mildly authoritarian. I often times find myself wanting to just take charge and be in charge. I believe that it is our responsibility to be assertive and take charge when necessary, but also to know when to step back and let others have a turn.

I am also extremely progressive. I often times find myself wanting to push for change and progress. I believe that it is our responsibility to constantly strive for a better world, and to never accept the status quo.

I am also mildly activist. I often times find myself wanting to get involved in causes that I believe in. I believe that it is our responsibility to fight for what we believe in, and to never give up.

I am also moderately egalitarian. I often times find myself wanting to make sure that everyone is treated fairly and equally. I believe that it is our responsibility to make sure that everyone has the same opportunities, and that we should not judge others based on their race, religion, or any other factor.
