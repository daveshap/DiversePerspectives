LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born into a eastern European family and throughout my childhood, we lived in different parts of the world. My parents were both heavily involved in the family business, which was Zoroastrianism. Due to this, I was home schooled and had little interaction with other children my age. I always had a very close relationship with my parents and siblings, which I believe has led to me being a very generous person.

Since I was not exposed to many people outside of my family, I was extremely curious about the world and everything in it. I spent a lot of time reading and exploring different cultures and religions. This also made me quite secular, as I did not have any real attachments to any one belief system. I was also quite pessimistic, which I think is a result of being exposed to so much negativity in the world.

While I am usually quite lazy, I am also very flexible and adaptable. This has enabled me to be quite successful in my chosen field of occupation, which is life, physical, and social science. I am also very thoughtful and have a great deal of focus when it comes to projects that I am passionate about. However, I can also be quite conservative and authoritarian when it comes to certain aspects of my life.

I am also quite anxious, which can be a struggle at times. However, I try to remain as peaceful as possible. I am also quite vain and believe that appearance is important. However, I am also very loving and kind, which I believe offsets some of my more negative qualities.

I had a somewhat difficult childhood, which has led to me being extremely forgiving. I also had a very young and destitute upbringing, which has made me extremely inclusive.
