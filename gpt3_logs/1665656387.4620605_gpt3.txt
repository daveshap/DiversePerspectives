I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in the Mediterranean region to a traditional family. My father was a legal professional and my mother was a stay-at-home mom. I have one older brother. I was a happy and healthy child, though I was always a bit more emotional than most. I had a difficult childhood in some ways, as my parents were very strict with me and my brother. We were expected to do well in school and to behave perfectly. Looking back, I can see that this was probably quite difficult for me, as I am extremely sensitive emotionally.

Thankfully, my parents were also very loving and supportive. They always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and to be the best that I could be. I attended a good school and was able to get into a good college. I studied legal matters and worked hard to get good grades. After I graduated, I found a job working as a legal professional. I am currentlysingle and I live alone in a small apartment.

Throughout my life, I have always been very generous. I have always been willing to help others, even if it meant sacrificing my own happiness. I am also quite progressive in my views, and I believe that everyone should be treated equally. I am an active supporter of LGBTQ rights and I believe that everyone should be free to love whoever they want. I am also quite health-conscious and I take care of myself. I eat healthy foods and I exercise regularly.

In conclusion, I am a kind, generous, and progressive person who has faced some challenges in life. However, I have overcome those challenges and I am now living my best life. I am happy with who I am and I am proud of the accomplishments that I have achieved.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am writing to express my concrete concerns about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a number of negative consequences for women, families, and society as a whole.

First and foremost, this bill would take away a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. This is a fundamental human right that must be respected. Additionally, this bill would put the lives of many women at risk. There arecases where abortion is the only safe option for a mother. Forcing women to carry to term in these cases could result in serious, even life-threatening, complications.

Additionally, this bill would likely result in an increase in illegal and unsafe abortions. When women are denied access to safe, legal abortions, they often resort to desperate measures. This can lead to dangerous and often deadly consequences.

Finally, this bill would disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color. These groups are already disadvantaged in our society, and this bill would only further marginalize them.

For these reasons, I urge you to veto this bill. Respect for women's rights, the lives of women, and the wellbeing of society as a whole demands it. Thank you for your consideration.
