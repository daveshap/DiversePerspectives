I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born into a wealthy family in the Sub-Saharan African country of Liberia. My parents were extremely traditional and wanted their children to be raised in the same way that they had been. As a result, I was sent to private schools and received a very well-rounded education. Unfortunately, my country was ravaged by a civil war when I was a teenager and my family was forced to flee to the United States.

Starting over in a new country was extremely difficult, but I was determined to make the best of it. I finished high school and then went on to receive my postsecondary education. I graduated with honors and was lucky enough to land a job in the installation, maintenance, and repair industry. I currently work for a very large company and enjoy my job.

In addition to my regular job, I am also progressive activist. I believe strongly in equality for all people, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation. I am an active member of the LGBTQ community and am constantly working to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.

Despite the challenges I have faced in my life, I remain optimistic and upbeat. I believe that all people have the potential to be good and that we all have the power to make the world a better place.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am extremely concerned about this proposed bill. If it is passed, it would ban all abortions under all circumstances, without exception. This would be a disaster for women's health and wellbeing.

First and foremost, this bill would take away a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. No one should be able to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body, and this bill would do just that. It would also have a devastating impact on women's health.

There are many cases in which an abortion is the only safe option for a pregnant woman. For example, if a woman is pregnant with a fetus that has a severe genetic abnormality, she may choose to have an abortion in order to avoid giving birth to a child who will suffer from a lifetime of health problems. Banning all abortions would prevent women from being able to make these types of decisions.

In addition, this bill would have a negative impact on a woman's mental health. In some cases, continuing a pregnancy can be extremely detrimental to a woman's mental health. For example, if a woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incest, she may suffer from intense trauma if she is forced to continue the pregnancy. Banning all abortions would prevent women from being able to get the help they need in these types of situations.

Lastly, this bill would essentially force women to have children they are not ready or able to care for. There are many women who choose to have abortions because they are not in a position to raise a child. For example, they may be financially unstable, or they may not have the emotional or mental capacity to care for a child. Banning all abortions would force these women to carry their pregnancies to term and would ultimately lead to more children being born into difficult and unsuitable situations.

Overall, this proposed bill is extremely dangerous and would have a devastating impact on women's lives. I urge lawmakers to reject it.
