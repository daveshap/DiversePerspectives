LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in 1990, in the former Soviet Union, to Eastern European parents who had both recently emigrated to the country. My early childhood was spent in a small town in the middle of nowhere, with few other kids my age to play with. My parents were both very religious, and I was brought up in a strict household where religious beliefs were treated as absolute Truth. Sundays were spent in church, and the rest of the week was spent in school or doing chores around the house. I was an inquisitive child, and I often questioned the things that I was taught. This led to quite a lot of conflict with my parents, who couldn't understand why I couldn't just accept things the way that they were.

As I grew older, I became more and more aware of the fact that I didn't fit into the mold that my parents had tried to force me into. I was attracted to other kids my own age, both boys and girls, and I knew that there was something different about me. I didn't understand what it was at the time, but I knew that I wasn't like other people. I was scared and confused, and I didn't know who to talk to about it.

When I was sixteen, I finally muster up the courage to come out to my parents as transgender. It was a difficult and scary conversation, but it was also a relief. I had been living a lie for so long, and I was finally able to be my true self. My parents took it surprisingly well, though they were obviously confused and upset. We sat down and talked about it, and they slowly started to come to terms with it.

A few years later, I left home and moved to the city to attend college. It was a huge culture shock, but I loved it. I was finally able to be myself without having to worry about what other people thought. I met new friends, explored my sexuality, and started to learn more about who I was. I also started to learn more about the world, and I became interested in social and political issues. I started to become more opinionated and outspoken, and I began to feel like I had a voice.

Since graduating from college, I have been working as a life, physical, and social science teacher. I love my job, and I feel like I'm making a difference in the lives of my students. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my partner, exploring the city, and going on adventures. I am also an active member of the LGBTQ+ community, and I am involved in various advocacy and activism efforts. I am constantly learning and growing, and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have been given.
