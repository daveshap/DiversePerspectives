I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a negative impact on women's health and well-being, and would ultimately hinder their ability to make decisions about their own bodies.

I am also concerned about the impact that this bill would have on low-income women and women of color. Banning abortions would disproportionately impact these groups of women, who are already at a disadvantage when it comes to access to healthcare.

Additionally, I am concerned that this bill would take away a woman's right to choose what is best for her own body and her own life. I believe that every woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body, and no one else should be able to tell her what she can or cannot do.

 Lastly, I am concerned about the precedent that this bill would set. If this bill were to become law, it would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to further restrictions on women's reproductive rights. I believe that this is a step in the wrong direction, and would ultimately erode the progress that has been made in recent years in terms of women's rights.
