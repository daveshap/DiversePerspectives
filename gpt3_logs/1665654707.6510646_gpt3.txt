LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in Australia to a traditional Aboriginal family. I grew up in a very remote area, with little contact with the outside world. My parents were very strict and traditional, and I was not allowed to do anything that they disapproved of. This made for a very difficult childhood, as I was constantly trying to rebel against their authority. I was extremely curious, and I would often sneak off into the bush to try and find new plants and animals. I was also very spiritual, and I would often go on "vision quests" in order to try and commune with the spirits.

When I was sixteen, I ran away from home and moved to the city. I started working as a bartender, and I soon realized that I was attracted to men. I started exploring my sexuality, and I eventually came out as gay. I also started exploring my gender identity, and I came to the conclusion that I was genderqueer. I changed my name and started dressing in a more masculine way.

I eventually went back to school and got my postsecondary education. I studied law, and I eventually started working as a lawyer. I am currently in a relationship with a man, and we are very happy together. I am also a practicing Buddhist, and I try to live my life in accordance with the principles of Buddhism.
