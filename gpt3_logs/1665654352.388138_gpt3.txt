LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

Growing up, I was always extremely curious. I was never content with just understanding things on a surface level – I always wanted to know the ins and outs, the “why” behind everything. This still holds true for me today – whether it’s picking apart an interesting news article or trying to understand how a new piece of technology works, I’m constantly striving to satisfy my curiosity.

Of course, this trait doesn’t always come in handy. More often than not, it leads me to asking a lot of questions – sometimes too many questions. I can be quite the nag when I’m not careful, constantly probing and badgering people for information. It can be frustrating for both me and the person I’m talking to, but I’ve generally found that it’s better to ask too many questions than too few.

In addition to being curious, I am also quite selfish. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it just means that I’m always looking out for myself and my own interests. I’m not above helping others, but I’m not going to go out of my way to do so if there’s nothing in it for me. This focus on self-preservation has helped me to be a fairly successful person, but it’s also led to some problems in my personal relationships.

I’m not an exceptionally spiritual person, but I do believe in some form of higher power. I’m not particularly religious, but I do find comfort in the rituals and traditions of Hinduism. I don’t regularly go to temple or participate in religious ceremonies, but I do try to live my life in a way that is consistent with Hindu values.

I am sexually attracted to men, which makes me a homosexual. I’ve never been in a relationship with a man, but I have had a few crushes and one-night stands. I’m not particularly open about my sexuality, but I’m also not in the closet. I’m somewhere in the middle – I’m comfortable talking about it if the topic comes up, but I’m not looking to broadcast it to the world.

I am a South Asian man. I was born in India and emigrated to the United States with my family when I was six years old. I grew up in a traditional Hindu household, but I now identify as more of a cultural Hindu. I still hold some of the values and beliefs of Hinduism, but I am not particularly spiritual.

I am aneducational instruction and library occupation. I have always been interested in education and knowledge, so this occupation suits me well. I work with people of all ages, and I enjoy helping others to learn and grow. I don’t have a lot of extra time outside of work, but when I do I like to spend it reading, researching, or exploring new educational opportunities.

I am a progressive person. I believe in social and economic equality for all people, regardless of race, gender, or sexuality. I am a strong advocate for women’s rights, and I believe that every person should have the right to live their life how they see fit, as long as they are not harming others. I am also a firm believer in the separation of church and state, and I think that religious beliefs should not be allowed to influence government policy.

I am an introverted person. I generally prefer to spend time alone or in small groups, and I don’t always outerstimulation. I like to take time to think about things before I speak or act, and I often need time to recharge after socializing. This introversion can sometimes be mistaken for rudeness or indifference, but it’s just how I am.

I am a tolerant person. I believe that everyone should be treated with respect, regardless of their race, gender, sexuality, or religion. I am also an inclusive person, and I believe that everyone should feel welcome and accepted. I don’t condone intolerance or exclusion, and I think that everyone deserves a fair chance.

I am a competitive person. I like to win, and I don’t take losing well. I’m always striving to be the best, and I often find myself comparing myself to others. This competitive streak can sometimes be problematic, but it’s also helped me to achieve a lot in life.

I am a collectivist person. I believe that the collective is more important than the individual, and I often put the needs of the group ahead of my own. I am a strong supporter of my community, and I believe that we are all in it together. I am also a supportive person
