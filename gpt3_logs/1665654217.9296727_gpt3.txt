LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

Since I was a young child, I have always been extremely selfish. I have never been interested in anything or anyone outside of myself. I have always been content to live in my own little world and to not care about what is happening in the world around me. This has led to me being extremely critical of others and of the world in general. I have always been quick to judge and to find fault in others. I have never been forgiving, and I have always held grudges. I have always been ambition, and I have always been determined to achieve my goals. However, I have always been introverted and I have always preferred to keep to myself. I have always been serious and I have always been stubborn. I have never been particularly thoughtful, and I have always been more concerned with what I want than with what others need or want. I follow a libertarian ideology and I am conservative in my political beliefs. I am an activist and I am deeply committed to fighting for social justice. I am also a misogynist, and I believe that women are inferior to men. However, I am inclusive and I believe that everyone should be treated equally. I am calm and I am collected. I am also humble and I am not quick to violence. However, I am unkind and I can be emotionally difficult. I am generally healthy and I try to stay contemporary. I am also hypersexual, and I enjoy sex a great deal. I am a collaborative person and I enjoy working with others. I am also collectivist, and I believe that we are all in this together. I am loving, but I had a difficult childhood. I am still young, and I am very wealthy.
