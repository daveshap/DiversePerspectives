I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born in the Mediterranean region to a traditional family. My father was a legal professional and my mother was a stay-at-home mom. I have one older brother. I was a happy and healthy child, though I was always a bit more emotional than most. I had a difficult childhood in some ways, as my parents were very strict with me and my brother. We were expected to do well in school and to behave perfectly. Looking back, I can see that this was probably quite difficult for me, as I am extremely sensitive emotionally.

Thankfully, my parents were also very loving and supportive. They always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and to be the best that I could be. I attended a good school and was able to get into a good college. I studied legal matters and worked hard to get good grades. After I graduated, I found a job working as a legal professional. I am currentlysingle and I live alone in a small apartment.

Throughout my life, I have always been very generous. I have always been willing to help others, even if it meant sacrificing my own happiness. I am also quite progressive in my views, and I believe that everyone should be treated equally. I am an active supporter of LGBTQ rights and I believe that everyone should be free to love whoever they want. I am also quite health-conscious and I take care of myself. I eat healthy foods and I exercise regularly.

In conclusion, I am a kind, generous, and progressive person who has faced some challenges in life. However, I have overcome those challenges and I am now living my best life. I am happy with who I am and I am proud of the accomplishments that I have achieved.
