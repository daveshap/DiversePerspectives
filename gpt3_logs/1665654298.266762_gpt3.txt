LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. My parents were both hardworking blue-collar workers and we never had much money. I always felt different from everyone else and I could never quite figure out why. At school, I was always a good student but I was never popular. I was always the weird kid who was into things that no one else cared about.

When I was sixteen, I came out as transgender to my parents. It was a hard thing to do but they were supportive. They didn't quite understand it but they loved me and wanted me to be happy. After coming out, I started to get more into my activism and I became very involved in my local LGBT community.

Since coming out, I have transitioned and I am now living my life as a woman. It has been a hard road but it has been worth it. I am happier now than I have ever been. I am still involved in my activism and I am always fighting for the rights of our community.

I am currently working in production and I love it. It is a demanding job but it is also very rewarding. I am also currently studying for my primary education degree. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my partner and our two dogs.

I am happy with who I am and I am proud of the life I have built for myself. I am constantly striving to make my world a better place and I will never stop fighting for what I believe in.
