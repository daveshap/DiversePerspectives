I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I am somewhat of a late bloomer when it comes to education. I only began my postsecondary studies after taking some time off from school following my high school graduation. I originally planned to go into computer science, but I soon found that I was more interested in the mathematical side of things. I ultimately decided to pursue a career in computer and mathematical occupations.

I am a non-binary male, which means that I do not identify as either male or female. I instead identify as a combination of both, or neither. I prefer to use masculine pronouns (he/him/his), but I am open to using any pronouns that people feel comfortable using for me. I am of sub-Saharan African descent, and I grew up in a Hindu household. I am heterosexual, but I am open-minded and inclusive of all sexualities.

I am quite selfish, and I often put my own needs and wants above those of others. I am also quite critical, both of myself and of others. I am not very curious, and I tend to take things at face value. I am quite spiritual, and I believe in reincarnation and karma. I am also quite calm, and I find that I am able to remain level-headed in most situations.

I am quite ambitious, and I have high aspirations for myself. I am also quite introverted, and I enjoy spending time alone or with only a few close friends. I am very serious, and I tend to approach life in a no-nonsense way. I am also quite stubborn, and I am not easily dissuaded from my opinion or point of view. I am moderately thoughtful, and I like to consider all sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion.

I am a libertarian, and I believe in personal freedom and individual liberty. I am also quite conservative, and I prefer to live my life in a traditional manner. I am not particularly activist, but I do believe in equal rights for all. I am moderately misogynistic, and I believe that women should be subordinate to men. I am also quite inclusive, and I believe that everyone should be treated with respect.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am concerned that this bill would have a number of material consequences, including:

1) An increase in the number of unsafe, illegal abortions, as women would be forced to seek out clandestine services in order to terminated their pregnancies;

2) An increase in maternal mortality, as women who are unable to obtain safe, legal abortions would be at greater risk of complications;

3) An increase in the number of children born into poverty or difficult circumstances, as women who are forced to carry to term may not be able to provide for their child;

4) A decrease in women's autonomy and control over their own bodies, as they would be forced to continue pregnancies that they may not want or be able to care for;

5) A general feeling of oppression and subordination among women, as they would be denied a fundamental right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.
