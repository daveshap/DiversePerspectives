I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born in the year 2000, in the months following the dot com crash. My parents had been successful in the industry, but like many others, they too were forced to readjust to a new reality. We moved from the big city to a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a massive culture shock for all of us, but my parents made the best of it.

I was a very tomboyish child and loved to play in the dirt and climb trees. I was also extremely enamored with all things related to computers, video games, and technology. I possibly could have become some sort of child prodigy if given the opportunity, but alas, we were living in the middle of nowhere and the nearest specialized school was a six hour drive away. So, I became a bit of a self-taught computer nerd.

Fortunately, my parents were incredibly supportive and encouraged my interests. As I got a bit older, we started going into the city on weekends so I could attend game design and coding workshops. I also started going to conventions and meeting people who shared my interests. It was through these experiences that I realized that I was transgender.

Coming out as transgender was a very difficult process. I was fortunate enough to have accepting and loving parents, but I worried about how the rest of the world would react. I knew that I would have to make some major changes in my life, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for that. But, with the support of my family and friends, I took the plunge and began my transition.

It hasn't been easy, but I am finally starting to feel like myself. I look forward to continuing my journey and sharing my story with others who may be going through something similar.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am vehemently opposed to this proposed bill. Declaring all abortions illegal is a gross violation of women's rights. Women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and no one else should have the right to dictate what they can or cannot do.

This bill would not only affect women who need or want abortions, but also those who have been the victim of rape or incest. Forcing these women to carry their rapist's child to term is unbelievably cruel. No one should be forced to relive their trauma over and over again.

Not to mention, making all abortions illegal would do nothing to stop them from happening. Women will still have abortions, but they will be forced to do so in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. This will lead to more injuries and deaths, not less.

If this bill becomes law, it will set women's rights back decades. We cannot let that happen. We must stand up and fight for our rights, before it's too late.
