LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in a small town in North Africa and raised in a equally small, equally unimportant town in the middle of nowhere. I grew up in poverty and my early childhood was spent mostly in survival mode, but I was a happy kid nonetheless. I was gifted with a creative mind and an affinity for the Arts, and I spent a lot of my time painting and drawing and making up stories. I loved all of it, and I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be an artist when I grew up.

Unfortunately, when I was around fifteen my parents' marriage began to unravel and things at home became increasingly chaotic and unstable. My father developed a drinking problem and my mother was left to deal with the lion's share of the household responsibilities and parenting duties. The financial situation at home also deteriorated, and we began to struggle even more than we had before.

At sixteen, I made the decision to drop out of school and get a job to try and help out with the family finances. It was around this time that I started to questioning my sexuality and gender identity. I had always felt different from other people, but I had never really understood why. It wasn't until I was a bit older and started to explore the world of non-binary genders and sexualities that I finally began to feel like I had found my place in the world.

I came out as non-binary to my family and friends when I was eighteen, and it was around this time that I also started to learn more about Islam. I had been born into a Muslim family, but we were not particularly religious and I had never really given much thought to my faith before. But as I started to learn more about Islam and its teachings, I began to feel a sense of connection to it and its values.

I embraced my faith wholeheartedly and started to wear a hijab, which was a decision that was met with a lot of negativity from the people around me. But I didn't care, because I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. I was still struggling financially, but I was managing to get by and I was happy.

Around the age of twenty-one, I decided to leave my home town and move to the city to pursue my dream of becoming an artist. It was a hard transition, and I had to work a series of odd jobs to make ends meet. But I was finally living my life on my own terms and I was happy.

I'm now twenty-four and I'm still pursuing my dream of becoming an artist. I'm slowly but surely making a name for myself in the art world, and I'm doing what I love. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm getting there. And I'm happy.
