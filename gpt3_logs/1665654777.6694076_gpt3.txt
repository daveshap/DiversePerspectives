LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

INTJ. Meditation.amacales@gmail.com

I grew up in an extremist cult in the Philippines--a dangerous, repressive sect of the slowly dying Christian faith. At the age of seven, I was pulled out of school by my parents and proselytized tirelessly. I was taught that the world was evil andheathen, and that only by submitting to the will of the church could I be saved. I was brainwashed into believing that any other way of life was tantamount to Heretic's reject.

I was not allowed to set foot outside the church compound. I was not allowed to watch television or movies, listen to music, or read anything other than religious texts. I was not even allowed to play with other children--'/socializing' was scorned as a worldly influence. As a result, I grew up extremely sheltered and isolated.

I was mad at the world. I was mad at God. I was mad at my parents. I was mad at the church. I was mad at myself.

I was a powder keg of anger and resentment, and it only took a small spark to set me off.

At the age of fourteen, I finally snapped. I couldn't take it anymore--I had to get out. I fled the compound in the middle of the night, and I didn't look back.

I was completely unprepared for the outside world. I had no education, no job skills, and no idea how to take care of myself. I was lost and alone in a cold, heartless world.

I did the only thing I could do--I turned to prostitution. It was a miserable, degrading existence, but it was the only way I could survive.

I hated myself. I hated my body. I hated my life.

But I was determined to make something of myself. I refused to be a victim. I refused to be anyone's punchline.

So I pulled myself up by my bootstraps and I started learning. I started reading voraciously, devouring anything I could get my hands on. I started teaching myself job skills, and eventually I carved out a place for myself in the world.

I'm not going to pretend that my story is unique or special. I know there are millions of other people out there who have gone through far worse.

But I want you to know that it is possible to overcome the worst circumstances. It is possible to find happiness and success even in the face of incredible adversity.

So never give up. Never give in. Never let anyone tell you that you're not good enough.

Because you are. You are worthy and deserving of everything good life has to offer.
