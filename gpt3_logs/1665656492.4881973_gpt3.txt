I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born into a wealthy family in the Sub-Saharan African country of Liberia. My parents were extremely traditional and wanted their children to be raised in the same way that they had been. As a result, I was sent to private schools and received a very well-rounded education. Unfortunately, my country was ravaged by a civil war when I was a teenager and my family was forced to flee to the United States.

Starting over in a new country was extremely difficult, but I was determined to make the best of it. I finished high school and then went on to receive my postsecondary education. I graduated with honors and was lucky enough to land a job in the installation, maintenance, and repair industry. I currently work for a very large company and enjoy my job.

In addition to my regular job, I am also progressive activist. I believe strongly in equality for all people, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation. I am an active member of the LGBTQ community and am constantly working to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.

Despite the challenges I have faced in my life, I remain optimistic and upbeat. I believe that all people have the potential to be good and that we all have the power to make the world a better place.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am absolutely opposed to this proposed bill. I believe that a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body is fundamental and should not be restricted in any way. I understand that some people believe that life begins at conception and, as a result, abortion is murder. However, I believe that a woman should be able to make the decision about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.

There are many reasons why a woman might choose to have an abortion. Maybe she is not ready to be a mother. Maybe she cannot afford to have a child. Maybe she is in an abusive relationship and is not able to protect her child. Whatever the reason, it should be up to the woman to decide whether or not to have an abortion.

Forcing a woman to carry a child to term against her will is inherently unfair and, in my opinion, is a form of oppression. No one knows what a woman is going through better than she does and, as a result, she should be the one to make the decision about whether or not to have an abortion.

So, in conclusion, I strongly oppose this proposed bill. I believe that it violates a woman's right to choose and would have a negative impact on society as a whole.
