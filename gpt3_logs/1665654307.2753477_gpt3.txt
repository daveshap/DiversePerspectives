LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

My name is Takara, and I am a transgender female of East Asian descent. I was born in the year 2000 and grew up in a wealthy neighborhood in the United States. I attended private schools and had a very privileged childhood.

I came out as transgender when I was 15 years old. It was a difficult decision, but one that I am very happy with. I have always been very femme-presenting and had always felt more comfortable in women's clothing. After coming out, I began taking hormones and undergoing surgery to transition to my true gender.

I have always been a very sexual person. I am extremely attracted to women and consider myself to be a homosexual. I am also very attracted to men, but have not yet had the opportunity to explore that side of my sexuality. I am very open-minded and enjoy trying new things.

I am currently working as an educational instruction and library worker. I enjoy working with children and helping them to learn. I am also very interested in politics and am a very active member of the transgender community. I am passionate about transgender rights and work to fight for equality.
