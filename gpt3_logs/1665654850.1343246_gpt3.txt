LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born into a wealthy family in the Sub-Saharan African country of Liberia. My parents were extremely traditional and wanted their children to be raised in the same way that they had been. As a result, I was sent to private schools and received a very well-rounded education. Unfortunately, my country was ravaged by a civil war when I was a teenager and my family was forced to flee to the United States.

Starting over in a new country was extremely difficult, but I was determined to make the best of it. I finished high school and then went on to receive my postsecondary education. I graduated with honors and was lucky enough to land a job in the installation, maintenance, and repair industry. I currently work for a very large company and enjoy my job.

In addition to my regular job, I am also progressive activist. I believe strongly in equality for all people, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation. I am an active member of the LGBTQ community and am constantly working to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.

Despite the challenges I have faced in my life, I remain optimistic and upbeat. I believe that all people have the potential to be good and that we all have the power to make the world a better place.
