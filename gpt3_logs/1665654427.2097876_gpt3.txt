LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

Born in the early 1990s, I was raised in a small town in Australia. My early childhood was relatively uneventful, but I always felt different from everyone else. I never truly fit in and always felt like an outsider. When I was around 11 years old, I realized that I was homosexual. This was a huge shock to me as I had always assumed that I was straight. It was a confusing and difficult time for me, but I eventually came to terms with my sexuality.

Since coming out, I have been extremely open about my sexuality and have been an active member of the LGBTQ+ community. I have always been a very critical person and have always been very interested in social and political issues. This has led me to pursue a career in law. I am currently in my final year of university and am looking forward to starting my career.

Throughout my life, I have always been a very spiritual person. I was introduced to Buddhism when I was 18 years old and it has had a profound impact on my life. I follow the teachings of the Buddha and try to live my life in accordance with his teachings. I believe that Buddhism has helped me to become a more compassionate and understanding person.

I am extremely close to my family and cherish my relationships with them. I am also very close to my partner and we share a deep love for each other. We have been together for over five years and have plans to get married in the near future.

Overall, I am a happy and content person. I am proud of who I am and what I have accomplished. I am looking forward to the future and am excited to see what it holds for me.
