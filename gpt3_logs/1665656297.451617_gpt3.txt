I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in North Africa and grew up in a large family. I had a difficult childhood, as my parents were both alcoholics and we were very poor. I was often malnourished and went without medical care. Despite all of this, I was a happy child who loved to play and explore the world around me.

I was always interested in the sciences, and when I was old enough, I started working in a lab. I loved the work and was soon promoted to a position where I was responsible for conducting experiments and analyzing data. I worked in the lab for many years, and it was during this time that I developed a deep interest in Islam.

I eventually left the lab to pursue a career in teaching. I wanted to share my love of science with others, and I believed that I could make a difference in the lives of my students. I taught for several years, and during this time, I also became more involved in my religion. I began attending Mosque regularly, and I started to wear a hijab.

After a few years, I started to feel like I was not making the impact I wanted to make in my students' lives. I decided to go back to school to get a degree in counseling. I thought that counseling would allow me to help my students in a more meaningful way.

I am now a counselor and I work with students who have been through similar experiences to what I went through as a child. I help them to understand their feelings and to make positive changes in their lives. I feel privileged to be able to help others in this way, and I hope to continue to make a difference in the lives of my students.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances in my country. I believe that this bill would have a negative impact on the lives of women, and I am opposed to it.

I understand that the bill is meant to protect the lives of unborn babies, but I believe that it would only serve to endanger the lives of women. Women who are forced to carry to term pregnancies that are risky or unwanted would be at risk of serious health complications. Additionally, women who are unable to access safe and legal abortions would be forced to seek out dangerous and illegal abortions, which could cost them their lives.

I believe thatbanning all abortions would take away a woman's right to choose what is best for her body and her life. I believe that every woman should have the right to make her own decisions about her body, and I believe that this bill would take away that right.

I am also concerned about the impact that this bill would have on women's mental health. Many women who have abortions do so because they are not ready to be mothers, and they may feel that they are not able to handle the responsibility. Banning all abortions could force some women to become mothers when they are not ready, which could lead to extreme stress and mental health problems.

I believe that this bill is poorly thought out and dangerous, and I urge my country's lawmakers to vote against it.
