LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am 20 years old, and I have never been what you could call "normal." I was born into a wealthy family, but I was never given the love or attention that I craved. My parents were always too busy with work to bother with me, so I was left to my own devices a lot of the time. As a result, I became extremely independent and self-sufficient at a young age.

I was also a very curious child, and I quickly realized that there was a whole world out there that I knew nothing about. I began to spend a lot of time researching different topics that interested me, and I became fascinated by the subjects of history, sociology, and psychology. I was also attracted to the idea of self-improvement, and I spent many hours reading books on philosophy, economics, and self-help.

When I was 17, I made the decision to leave my parents' home and struck out on my own. I realized that I didn't fit into the world that they had created for me, and that I needed to find my own way in life. I spent a year living in different cities, working various odd jobs, and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.

Eventually, I decided to go back to school and get a formal education. I had always been a bright student, so I was able to get into a good college. I decided to study life, physical, and social sciences, and I eventually became a teacher.

I have always been a very independent person, and I have never been afraid to defy conventions. I transitioned from male to female when I was 19 years old, and I openly identify as a transgender woman. I am also homosexual, and I have never tried to hide or downplay my sexuality.

I believe that everyone should be free to live their lives as they see fit, and I am always willing to fight for the rights of minorities. I am an extremely liberal person, and I am constantly striving to make the world a more inclusive and tolerant place.
