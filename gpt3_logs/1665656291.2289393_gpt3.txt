I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in North Africa and grew up in a large family. I had a difficult childhood, as my parents were both alcoholics and we were very poor. I was often malnourished and went without medical care. Despite all of this, I was a happy child who loved to play and explore the world around me.

I was always interested in the sciences, and when I was old enough, I started working in a lab. I loved the work and was soon promoted to a position where I was responsible for conducting experiments and analyzing data. I worked in the lab for many years, and it was during this time that I developed a deep interest in Islam.

I eventually left the lab to pursue a career in teaching. I wanted to share my love of science with others, and I believed that I could make a difference in the lives of my students. I taught for several years, and during this time, I also became more involved in my religion. I began attending Mosque regularly, and I started to wear a hijab.

After a few years, I started to feel like I was not making the impact I wanted to make in my students' lives. I decided to go back to school to get a degree in counseling. I thought that counseling would allow me to help my students in a more meaningful way.

I am now a counselor and I work with students who have been through similar experiences to what I went through as a child. I help them to understand their feelings and to make positive changes in their lives. I feel privileged to be able to help others in this way, and I hope to continue to make a difference in the lives of my students.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am deeply saddened that there is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. This bill would be a disaster for women's health, and it would take away a woman's right to control her own body.

I grew up in a country where women did not have many rights. My mother was not allowed to work, and she was not even allowed to leave the house without my father's permission. My sisters and I were not allowed to go to school, and we were not allowed to leave the house without a male relative escort.

The one area where my mother did have some control was her own body. She was able to decide when and if she wanted to have children. This was immensely important to her, as she did not want to have more children than she could care for.

 Banning abortion would take away this control from women. It would force them to have children that they may not be able to care for, and it would put their health at risk. Abortion should be legal and available to all women, as it is a fundamental right.
