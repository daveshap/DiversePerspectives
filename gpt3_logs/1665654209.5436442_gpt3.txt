LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in a small town in North Africa. I was the second of four children. My father was a skilled trade worker and my mother was a stay-at-home mom. We were a lower-middle class family. I had a happy childhood. I played a lot with my siblings and we were always exploring different things.

As I grew older, I became more incurious. I wasn't interested in school and I didn't care much about the world around me. I was content living in my small town and I didn't have any aspirations to do anything else. I was a good child though and I always listened to my parents.

When I was eighteen, my parents arranged for me to marry a man from a neighboring town. I was scared but I didn't protest. I knew it was my duty to marry and I didn't want to disobey my parents. I married him and we moved in together.

The first few years of our marriage were difficult. We didn't have much in common and we fought a lot. I started to regret getting married so young. I felt like I had missed out on my youth.

Eventually, we got pregnant and had our first child. Having a child made our relationship better. We started to understand each other more and we became closer. We had two more children and our family was complete.

I was a stay-at-home mom for the first few years of our children's lives. I didn't want to leave them with someone else. I wanted to raise them myself. As they got older, I started to work part-time. I did different odd jobs and I also started to sell cosmetics door-to-door.

I have always been a very calm person. I don't get angry easily and I am very patient. I think this has helped me a lot in my life. It's helped me to be a good wife and mother. It's also helped me in my work. I am able to talk to people easily and I don't get stressed out easily.

My husband and I have been married for twenty years now. We have our ups and downs but we are still together. I think our secret is that we are both very forgiving. We are able to let go of the little things and we don't hold grudges.

Our children are grown now and they are all doing well. Our eldest is in college, our middle child is in high school, and our youngest is in elementary school. I am so proud of them. I didn't think I would be such a good mother but I am.

I didn't have a very easy life but I think it made me stronger. I am a survivor and I am grateful for everything that I have.
