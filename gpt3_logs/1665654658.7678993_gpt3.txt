LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am a highly unique individual with a very eclectic background and life story. For starters, I was homeschooled my entire life. This has allowed me to develop a very independent and entrepreneurial spirit. I have also always been very interested in the Arts, having dabbled in things like painting, acting, and writing throughout my life.

I am also transgender, female-to-male. This has been a very enriching and empowering experience for me, and has allowed me to see the world from a very different perspective. Being transgender has also helped me to be more compassionate and understanding towards others, as I know first-hand how it feels to be misunderstood and marginalized.

I am of Eastern European descent, and my family has always been very involved in our cultural heritage. We are Zoroastrian, and our faith is very important to us. I have always been very drawn to the Zoroastrian way of life and its principles of truth, goodness, and justice.

I currently work in the Life, Physical, and Social Sciences, and I absolutely love it. It is a very rewarding field, and I feel lucky to be able to work in such an important and impactful field.

On a personal level, I am a very secular person. I do not adhere to any one religion or set of beliefs. I am also extremely lactose intolerant and have a great aversion to mushrooms. I am also mildly curious, extremely introverted, and extremely lazy.

I am extremely forgiving, and I believe that everyone deserves a second chance. I am also very flexible and adaptable, and I think that this is one of my greatest strengths. I am also very loving and affectionate, and I enjoy being around people.

I had a very difficult childhood, and as a result, I am extremely young and destitute. However, I feel that this has only made me stronger and more resilient. I am also very contemporary and hypersexual. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment, and I feel that everyone has something to offer. I am also very collectivist, and I believe that we are all in this together.
