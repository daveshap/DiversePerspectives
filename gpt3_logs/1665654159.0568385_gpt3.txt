LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in a small town in Eastern Europe and my early childhood was spent in a remote village where my family had a small farm. My early years were very simple and sheltered, and I had very little contact with the outside world. This all changed when I was eight years old and my family moved to the city. It was a very culture shock for me, and I struggled to adjust to this new way of life.

In the city, I attended a traditional school and for the first time, I was exposed to other children from different backgrounds and upbringings. It was here that I first began to realise that I was different from other people. I was always one of the tallest kids in my class, and I had a deep voice which made me stand out even more. I was also very attracted to other boys, which made me feel even more isolated and different.

As I grew older, I began to experiment with my gender expression and started to dress in more feminine clothes. This caused a lot of confusion and consternation among my classmates, and I was often the target of bullying and ridicule. I struggled to fit in and made very few friends. And, as I entered puberty, my attraction to other boys became even more pronounced.

This was a very difficult time for me, and I became increasingly withdrawn and depressed. I couldn't see a way out or a way to be who I knew I was. I turned to religion for solace, and I became very interested in Zoroastrianism. This gave me a sense of peace and calm, and I slowly began to accept myself for who I was.

In my late teens, I decided to come out as transgender and begin my transition. This was a very difficult process, but with the support of my family and friends, I slowly began to build a new life for myself. I changed my name, started hormone therapy, and had surgery to correct my gender dysphoria.

Now, in my early twenties, I am finally starting to feel like I am in the right body and living my life the way I want to. I am still exploring my gender identity and sexuality, and I am finding my place in the world. I am slowly making friends and building a new support system, and I am beginning to feel more hopeful about my future.
