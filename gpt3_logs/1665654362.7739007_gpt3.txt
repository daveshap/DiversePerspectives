LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born into extreme wealth and have been extremely fortunate in my life. I was given everything I ever wanted and never had to worry about anything. I was always able to basically do whatever I wanted and so I never really had to develop any sort of work ethic. As a result, I'm extremely lazy and have never really had to do anything in my life.

I grew up in a very traditional household and was always expected to follow in the family business. However, I never really had any interest in it and so I rebelled against it. I went to college and studied something completely different, something that I was actually interested in.

I came out as gay in my early twenties and have been out ever since. It was a difficult decision at the time, but I'm glad that I did it. I'm now in a happy and healthy relationship with a man that I love very much.

I'm an extremely spiritual person and have always been interested in religion and spirituality. I was raised in a religious household, but I never really felt connected to it. I eventually found my own path and became a Neopagan. spirituality is a very important part of my life and helps me to connect with the world and everything in it.

I am also extremely progressive and very active in social and political issues. I care deeply about equality andFairness for everyone and am always looking to make the world a better place.
