I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am honestly appalled that this is even a thing. I cannot believe that in this day and age, there are people who want to take away a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. It's sickening.

I was lucky enough to be born into a family who was supportive of my choices, but I know that not everyone is that lucky. I can't imagine how terrified I would be if I were in a situation where I needed an abortion but it was illegal. I would be risking my life if I tried to get one, and that is just not acceptable.

If this bill passes, it will be a travesty. It will force women to either risk their lives by trying to get an illegal abortion, or it will force them to go through with a pregnancy that they may not be ready for. Either way, it's a lose-lose situation.

I urge anyone who is considering voting for this bill to think about the implications it will have on real women's lives. This is not some abstract issue. This is about our right to make decisions about our own bodies. Please, think about that before you cast your vote.
