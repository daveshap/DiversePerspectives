LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

When people ask me about myself, I always tell them that I am a very complex person. I was born in the Sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria. However, I grew up in the United States from the age of three. Because of this, I identify as an American citizen. I am also black and my race has always been a huge part of my identity. I went to a predominately white high school and was one of only a handful of black students. This experience made me very aware of race and discrimination.

I am also genderqueer. This means that I do not identify as either male or female. I use the pronouns he/him/his and they/them/theirs. I did not always know that I was genderqueer. It was not until college that I realized that the way I felt about my gender did not fit into the socially prescribed gender binary. This was a huge revelation for me and it has taken me a long time to come to terms with my gender identity.

I am also homosexual. I have been attracted to men since I can remember. I knew that I was different from a very young age. I did not come out to my family and friends until I was a senior in high school. This was a very difficult experience for me, but it was also liberating. I am now very open about my sexuality and I believe that it is a beautiful and essential part of who I am.

I am also extremely spiritual. I practice Neopaganism, which is a modern Pagan religious movement. I have always been interested in the spiritual and mystical aspects of life. Neopaganism allows me to express my spirituality in a way that is meaningful to me. I am also a very active member of my local Pagan community. I participate in many of the activities and events that are organized by the community.

I am also a very passionate person. I am very generous and loving. I am also very vengeful and critical. I have a strong sense of justice and I will always fight for the underdog. I am also very spiritual and I believe that there is more to life than what meets the eye. I am a very complex person and I believe that this is what makes me unique and special.
