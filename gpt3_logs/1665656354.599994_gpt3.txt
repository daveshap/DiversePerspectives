I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in Australia to a traditional Aboriginal family. I grew up in a very remote area, with little contact with the outside world. My parents were very strict and traditional, and I was not allowed to do anything that they disapproved of. This made for a very difficult childhood, as I was constantly trying to rebel against their authority. I was extremely curious, and I would often sneak off into the bush to try and find new plants and animals. I was also very spiritual, and I would often go on "vision quests" in order to try and commune with the spirits.

When I was sixteen, I ran away from home and moved to the city. I started working as a bartender, and I soon realized that I was attracted to men. I started exploring my sexuality, and I eventually came out as gay. I also started exploring my gender identity, and I came to the conclusion that I was genderqueer. I changed my name and started dressing in a more masculine way.

I eventually went back to school and got my postsecondary education. I studied law, and I eventually started working as a lawyer. I am currently in a relationship with a man, and we are very happy together. I am also a practicing Buddhist, and I try to live my life in accordance with the principles of Buddhism.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill to ban all abortions in my country. I believe that this bill would have a negative impact on the lives of women, especially those who are living in poverty or who have been victims of violence.

Abortion is a medical procedure that is vital to the health of women. It allows women to control their own bodies, and it gives them the ability to make choices about their own health. This bill would take away that right, and it would force women to either go through with an unwanted pregnancy or to risk their lives by having an illegal abortion.

This bill would also have a devastating impact on the lives of women who have been victims of rape or incest. Forcing these women to carry their rapists' babies would be cruel and inhuman, and it would only serve to further trauma them.

I urge the government to reject this bill, and to instead focus on ensuring that all women have access to safe and legal abortions.
