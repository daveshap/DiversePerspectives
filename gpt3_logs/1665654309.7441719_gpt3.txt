LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in the year 2000, in the month of January. I grew up in the suburbs of a large city. I never really had a lot of friends, but I was always content with my own company. I loved reading and spending time outdoors. When I was 10 years old, I realized that I was transgender. This was a very difficult time for me, as I had to come to terms with the fact that I was not the person that I had always thought I was. I began transitioning when I was 12 years old, and it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.

I am now 23 years old and I have been living as a woman for over 10 years. It has been a long and difficult journey, but I am finally at a point where I am comfortable in my own skin. I transitioned without the support of my family or friends, so it was really just me against the world. I can honestly say that it was worth it though, because I am happier now than I have ever been.

I currently work as an educational instruction and library assistant. I love my job, as it allows me to work with children and help them to learn and grow. It is a very rewarding profession. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, spending time outdoors, and spending time with my cat, Pumpkin.

I am an atheist, and I see this world as a place where we are all just temporary occupants. I do not believe in an afterlife, or in anything that happens after death. For me, this life is all we have, so we should make the most of it.

I am a very kind person, and I believe that everyone should be treated with respect. I am also quite emotionally sensitive, so I often take things to heart. I am a bit of a perfectionist, and I always strive to be the best that I can be.
