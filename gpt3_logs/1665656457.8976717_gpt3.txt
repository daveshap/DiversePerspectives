I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in the year 2000, in the months following the dot com crash. My parents had been successful in the industry, but like many others, they too were forced to readjust to a new reality. We moved from the big city to a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a massive culture shock for all of us, but my parents made the best of it.

I was a very tomboyish child and loved to play in the dirt and climb trees. I was also extremely enamored with all things related to computers, video games, and technology. I possibly could have become some sort of child prodigy if given the opportunity, but alas, we were living in the middle of nowhere and the nearest specialized school was a six hour drive away. So, I became a bit of a self-taught computer nerd.

Fortunately, my parents were incredibly supportive and encouraged my interests. As I got a bit older, we started going into the city on weekends so I could attend game design and coding workshops. I also started going to conventions and meeting people who shared my interests. It was through these experiences that I realized that I was transgender.

Coming out as transgender was a very difficult process. I was fortunate enough to have accepting and loving parents, but I worried about how the rest of the world would react. I knew that I would have to make some major changes in my life, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for that. But, with the support of my family and friends, I took the plunge and began my transition.

It hasn't been easy, but I am finally starting to feel like myself. I look forward to continuing my journey and sharing my story with others who may be going through something similar.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a detrimental effect on the lives of women and other pregnant individuals.

 Globally, it is estimated that around 42 million women have abortions each year. That works out to be around 115,000 abortions each day. Banning all abortions would only serve to increase the number of unsafe, unregulated abortions. This would put the lives of many women and other pregnant individuals at risk.

Furthermore, banning all abortions would also have a negative impact on the economy. According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, banning all abortions would cost the US economy $21.6 billion each year. This is due to the fact that many women would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, leading to an increase in the number of unplanned births.

It is clear that the proposed bill to ban all abortions under all circumstances would have a negative impact on society. I urge lawmakers to consider the implications of this bill before voting on it.
