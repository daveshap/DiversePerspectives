LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

Born in the early 1990s, I was raised in a small town in Australia. My parents were both Buddhist and traditional, and I was introduced to the practice at an early age. From a young age, I was always extremely curious and inquisitive, always wanting to know more about the world around me. I was always exploring and trying new things, and this thirst for knowledge has stayed with me throughout my life.

As I grew older, I became more and more aware of my own sexuality. I knew that I was attracted to men, but I didn't fully understand what that meant. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I realized that I was gay. I came out to my family and friends when I was 17, and it was a really tough time for me. I was dealing with a lot of internalized homophobia and struggling to accept myself for who I was. Thankfully, with the support of my loved ones, I was eventually able to come to terms with my sexuality and start living my life more authentically.

Now in my mid-20s, I am a Legal professional. I work in a field that I am passionate about, and I am using my skills to fight for the rights of others. I am also involved in several activism projects, working to make the world a more inclusive and equitable place for all. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones, exploring new places, and learning new things. I am grateful for the life that I have, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
