LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am a product of my environment. I grew up in a rough neighborhood and didn't have much. My parents didn't value education and I was expected to follow in their footsteps and get a job as soon as I was done with school. I was a rebellious teenager and didn't do well in school. I dropped out of high school and got a job at a local factory. I worked there for a few years before I realized that I wasn't going to be able to make a good life for myself if I didn't get an education.

I decided to go back to school and get my GED. After I got my GED, I enrolled in community college. I worked my way through school and eventually transferred to a four-year university. I graduated with my degree in legal studies and went on to become a lawyer.

I am now a successful lawyer and I have a happy and fulfilling life. I credit my success to my determination and hard work. I believe that everyone has the potential to be successful, no matter where they come from or what obstacles they face.
