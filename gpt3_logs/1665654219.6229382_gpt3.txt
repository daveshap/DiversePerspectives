LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born into a wealthy family in Sub-Saharan Africa. My father was a powerful spiritual leader in our community and my mother was a successful businesswoman. I was the youngest of four children and grew up with every advantage money could buy. I was educated at the best schools, had access to the best resources, and had a priviliged upbringing.

However, I was also a very difficult child. I was extremely stubborn and had a very strong will. I didn't care about other people and I was highly critical of everyone and everything. My siblings and parents often had to put up with my outbursts and tempers. I was also highly introverted and spent a lot of time alone. I was extremely serious and didn't have much time for fun or games.

Despite all of this, I was still a very intelligent and successful student. I excelled in my studies and was always at the top of my class. I was also a very talented computer programmer and had a natural aptitude for mathematics. After I finished my schooling, I went on to get a degree in computer science from a prestigious university.

Since graduating, I have worked as a software engineer for a number of different companies. I have been extremely successful in my career and have earned a great deal of money. I am currently single and live a very comfortable lifestyle. I enjoy travelling and exploring new cultures, and I am also a collector of art and antiques.

Despite my many successes, I remains a very selfish and unkind person. I have never been in a long-term relationship and I am not interested in having children. I can be cold and aloof with people and I have difficulty showing affection. I am also extremely analytical and tend to overthink things.

However, I am also a very successful and driven individual. I am passionate about my work and I am always looking for new challenges. I am also a very independent person and I like to be in control of my own life. I am confident and self-assured, and I believe that I can achieve anything I set my mind to.
