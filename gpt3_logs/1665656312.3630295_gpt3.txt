I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in North Africa and grew up in a large family. I had a difficult childhood, as my parents were both alcoholics and we were very poor. I was often malnourished and went without medical care. Despite all of this, I was a happy child who loved to play and explore the world around me.

I was always interested in the sciences, and when I was old enough, I started working in a lab. I loved the work and was soon promoted to a position where I was responsible for conducting experiments and analyzing data. I worked in the lab for many years, and it was during this time that I developed a deep interest in Islam.

I eventually left the lab to pursue a career in teaching. I wanted to share my love of science with others, and I believed that I could make a difference in the lives of my students. I taught for several years, and during this time, I also became more involved in my religion. I began attending Mosque regularly, and I started to wear a hijab.

After a few years, I started to feel like I was not making the impact I wanted to make in my students' lives. I decided to go back to school to get a degree in counseling. I thought that counseling would allow me to help my students in a more meaningful way.

I am now a counselor and I work with students who have been through similar experiences to what I went through as a child. I help them to understand their feelings and to make positive changes in their lives. I feel privileged to be able to help others in this way, and I hope to continue to make a difference in the lives of my students.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill to ban all abortions under all circumstances in my country. I believe that this bill would have a negative impact on the lives of women and girls, and it would ultimately lead to more harm than good.

First and foremost, the ban on abortion would likely lead to an increase in unplanned pregnancies and maternal mortality. Women who are unable to access safe and legal abortion services will often resort to dangerous and illegal methods, which can result in death or serious health complications. For instance, in countries where abortion is illegal, it is estimated that 68,000 women die each year from complications related to unsafe abortion (World Health Organization, 2018).

Moreover, the ban on abortion would disproportionately impact young girls and women from lower-income families. These groups of women are often the most vulnerable and least able to access safe and legal abortion services. Consequently, they would be the most likely to suffer from the negative consequences of the ban, such as unplanned pregnancies and maternal mortality.

In addition, the ban on abortion would impact women's mental health. Many women who have abortions experience relief and a sense of empowerment after the procedure (American Psychological Association, 2008). For some women, having an abortion can be a life-saving decision. For example, women who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest often suffer from mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If they are denied access to abortion services, they may be forced to carry the pregnancy to term, which can worsen their mental health.

Finally, the ban on abortion would also have negative economic consequences. Unplanned pregnancies can lead to lost productivity at work, and they can also put a financial strain on families. In addition, maternal mortality rates would likely increase, as would the cost of healthcare for women who experience complications from unsafe abortions.

 Ultimately, I believe that the disadvantages of the proposed bill far outweigh any potential benefits. I urge the government to reconsider this bill, and to instead focus on measures that would improve access to safe and legal abortion services for all women.
