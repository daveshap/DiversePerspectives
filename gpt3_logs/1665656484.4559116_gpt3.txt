I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I am an Indian national and I grew up in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. I am the youngest of three siblings. My father is a businessman and my mother is a homemaker. I attended a Catholic school till eighth grade and then completed my high school at a government school. I graduated from college with a degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry. I worked as a desk clerk at a hotel for a year before getting a job as an English teacher at a school. I taught for two years and then I decided to pursue a Masters in Education. I completed my Master's degree and started working as a guidance counsellor at a school. I also started working as a freelance writer during this time. I wrote articles for magazines and newspapers on various topics.

I have always been interested in writing and I have been writing stories since I was a child. When I was in high school, I used to write short stories and submit them to competitions. I never won any of those competitions but that didn't discourage me from writing. I continued writing and eventually started getting publishing offers. I have published two books so far, one of short stories and the other a novel. I am currently working on my third book, a collection of essays.

I have always been a very curious person and I like to learn new things. I am always exploring new hobbies andinterests. I have a very active social life and I love spending time with my friends. I am also very competitive and I like to be the best at everything I do. I am extremely collectivist and I believe that we are all in this together. We are all connected and we should help each other. I am also extremely inclusive and I believe that everyone should be given the same opportunities regardless of their background or identity.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

If this bill is passed, it would have a massive negative impact on women's lives. It would criminalize abortion, and punitive measures would be put in place against women who have them. This would lead to a host of problems, including an increase in illegal and unsafe abortions, and a decrease in overall women's health. Additionally, it would disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color, who would be less likely to have access to safe and legal abortion services. It would also further limiting women's reproductive autonomy and choice.

This bill is thus radically anti-woman, and would have a disastrous impact on women's lives if it is passed. I urge you to do everything in your power to stop it from becoming law.
