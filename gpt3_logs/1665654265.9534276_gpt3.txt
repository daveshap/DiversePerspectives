LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am a person who is extremely generous. I always have been. I remember when I was a kid, my mom would often tell me that I was too generous for my own good. And she was right. I would often give away my things without thinking about it. I would give away my toys to other kids, even if I didn't know them that well. I would give away my clothes to people who needed them more than I did. And I would always help out anyone who needed it, regardless of who they were.

I think that my generosity comes from a place of wanting to make everyone happy. I hate seeing people suffer, and I want to do anything I can to make their lives better. Even if it means sacrificing my own happiness. I would rather see someone else happy than have something for myself.

I am also a person who is moderately incurious. I am not the type of person who is always asking questions. I like to observe and take things in. I often find myself in Situation A, where I am not asking questions, but just observing and trying to figure things out on my own. This can sometimes get me into trouble because I don't always have all the information. But I prefer to take my time and figure things out on my own, rather than always rely on someone else to tell me what to do.

I am also mildly secular. I was raised in a religion, but I never really had a strong connection to it. I would say that I am more of a humanist or secularist. I believe that we should focus on making this world a better place for all humans, rather than worrying about what happens after we die. I think that we should all be treated equally, regardless of our religious beliefs.

I am extremely pessimistic. I am the type of person who always expects the worst. I am always assuming that things are going to go wrong. And more often than not, they do. I have a hard time being optimistic, because I feel like I'm just setting myself up for disappointment.

I am also mildly gullible. I tend to believe what people tell me, even if there is no evidence to support it. I think part of this is because I want to believe the best in people. I want to believe that they are being truthful and honest with me. But this can sometimes get me into trouble.

I am moderately vengeful. I believe that if someone wrongs me, I have the right to seek revenge. I don't always act on this belief, but I often think about it. I think that people who wrong me deserve to be punished. And I will often go out of my way to make sure that they are.

I am moderately lazy. I am not the type of person who is always energetic and ready to go. I often have to force myself to do things. I don't like having to do things, but I often do them anyway because I know that they need to be done.

I am also moderately introverted. I am not the type of person who is always looking to be around people. I often find myself wanting to be alone. I like to have time to myself, where I can just relax and think. I don't always like being in large groups of people, because I feel like I can't really be myself.

I am mildy playful. I like to joke around and have fun. I am not the type of person who is always serious. I often find myself making jokes, even when they are not appropriate. I think that humor is important, and I often use it to defuse tense situations.

I am mildly stubborn. I don't like to back down from a fight. I often find myself wanting to stick to my guns, even when it might not be the best thing to do. I think that this is because I don't like to admit when I'm wrong. I hate feeling like I've made a mistake, and I will often hold on to my beliefs even when they are proven to be wrong.

I am mildly thoughtful. I often find myself thinking about things that are important to me. I like to think about the future, and I often make plans for what I want to do. I also like to think about the past, and I often reflect on my experiences. I think that it is important to think about the things that are important to you, and I often do.

I am mildly authoritarian. I believe that people should obey authority figures. I think that it is important to have respect for those in positions of power. I often find myself following the rules, even when I don't agree with them. I think that it is important to follow the rules, even when they are unjust.

I am extremely progressive. I believe that we should always be moving forward
