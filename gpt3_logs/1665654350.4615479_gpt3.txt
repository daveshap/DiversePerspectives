LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am an LGBTQIA+ individual who was born and raised in the United States. I came from a lower-middle class upbringing and I have always been extremely determined to achieve success in life. One of my defining characteristics is my extreme selfishness- I have always been singularly focused on my own goals and aspirations. This has served me well in many ways, but it has also led to me being perceived as distant and unemotional by those closest to me. 

I am also extremely curious and critical. I have always been interested in the world around me and I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge. I am always questioning everything and I have a very skeptical outlook on life. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as it has led me to be a very critical thinker but it has also made me very quick to judge others. 

I am only mildly spiritual, but I am very interested in religion and its impact on society. I was raised Hindu but I am not particularly attached to any one faith. I am more interested in the philosophy and social justice aspects of religion. 

I am somewhat Optimistic, in that I believe that things will eventually get better even if they are bad right now. This has helped me get through some difficult times in my life. However, I am also very critical and I have a very dark sense of humor. I often make jokes about difficult or taboo subjects as a way of dealing with them. 

I am only moderately vengeful, but I do believe in Karma. I try to live my life in a way that I hope will lead to good things happening to me, but I also understand that sometimes bad things happen to good people. 

I am only moderately lazy, but I do enjoy taking breaks and doing things that I find enjoyable. I am very curious and I like to learn new things, but I also like to relax and watch television or read books. 

I am only mildly introverted, but I do enjoy spending time alone. I like to be around people, but I also like to have time to myself to think and reflect. 

I am only mildly serious, but I do take my commitments and responsibilities very seriously. I am a very reliable and trustworthy person, but I also like to have fun and I am not afraid to be silly. 

I am only mildly stubborn, but I do have very strong opinions and I am not afraid to stand up for what I believe in. I am also very open-minded and I am willing to listen to others and consider their perspectives. 

I am only mildly thoughtful, but I do put a lot of thought into my words and actions. I like to think things through before I speak or act, but I am also very spontaneous and I like to go with the flow. 

I am only mildly libertarian, but I do believe that people should be free to live their lives as they see fit as long as they are not harming others. I also believe in the power of the individual and I think that everyone has the potential to be great. 

I am extremely progressive and I believe in social, political, and economic equality for all people. I am a firm believer in democracy and I think that everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. I am also very inclusive and I believe that all people, regardless of their background or identity, should be treated with respect. 

I am only mildly anxious, but I do get anxious about things that are important to me. I am also very humble and I do not like to boast about my accomplishments. I would rather let my actions speak for themselves. 

I am extremely peaceful and I try to avoid conflict whenever possible. I am also very emotionally robust and I am not easily offended. I am also unkind and I can be very insensitive to the needs of others. 

I am extremely competitive and I love to win. I am also very collectivist and I believe that we are all in this together. I am also very loving and I believe that love is the most powerful force in the universe. 

I had a stable childhood and I was raised by loving parents. I am also very young and I have my whole life ahead of me. I am destitute, but I am determined to make something of myself.
