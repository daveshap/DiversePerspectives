LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

As far back as I can remember, I have always been extremely selfish. It has always been all about me and what I can get out of any given situation. I really don't care about anyone else, and I'm not really all that curious about the world around me. I am completely focused on myself and my own needs and wants.

This selfishness extends to my spiritual life as well. I am only mildly interested in religion and spirituality, and I only really care about it insofar as it benefits me. I am not at all interested in helping others or making the world a better place. I am only interested in what I can get out of my spiritual practice.

This selfishness and self-centeredness is also reflected in my political views. I am a libertarian and I strongly believe in individual rights and freedom. I am not interested in working for the common good or promoting social justice. I only care about myself and my own rights and freedom.

This selfishness has also led me to be quite critical of others. I am quick to judge and criticize others, and I am not very forgiving. I also have a strong sense of right and wrong, and I am not afraid to speak my mind. I can be quite opinionated and I can be quite stubborn.

Despite all of this, I am actually quite calm and even-tempered. I don't get rattled easily, and I don't let my emotions get the better of me. I am also quite humble and I don't need to be the center of attention.

On the flip side, I can be quite unkind and even violent at times. I have a very dark side, and I can be quite misanthropic. I also have a very high sex drive, and I am often engaged in promiscuous and casual sex.

I am also extremely collectivist and I strongly believe in the power of the collective. I believe that we are all in this together, and that we are all interconnected. I am also very loving and I have a lot of love to give.

Despite all of this, I had a very difficult childhood. I was raised in a wealthy family, but I was never really loved or accepted. I always felt like an outsider, and I was always searching for something to fill the void.

I was also raised in a very conservative andreligious family, and I was never really allowed to express myself. I always felt stifled and oppressed, and I longed to be free.

I am also quite young. I am in my early twenties, and I am still trying to figure out who I am and what I want in life. I am still trying to find my place in the world, and I am still trying to make sense of my past.
