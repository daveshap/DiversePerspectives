LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in the Mediterranean and have always been attracted to other men. Since I was a young child, I have always been drawn to the more emotionally sensitive types. I am extremely emotionally sensitive myself and sometimes find it difficult to express my emotions in traditional ways. This has led to me being highly competitive in many areas of my life. I am also very healthy and have always been interested in health and fitness.

I have a postsecondary education and am currently working in the legal field. I am progressive and inclusive in my thinking, and highly tolerant of others. I am also a bit of an activist, working for equality and justice in the world. I came from a difficult childhood and had to face many challenges in my life, but I am now doing well and am happy with who I am.
