LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am a legal professional with a postsecondary education. I was born into a Mediterranean genetic population and my family later immigrated to North America. I identify as a homosexual male and have a humanist or secularist orientation.

I am generally a very generous person. I like to help others and I am often one of the first people to offer assistance if I see someone in need. I also tend to be quite incurious and I don't often ask questions when I meet new people or enter new situations. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as uninterested or impolite, but it is just my nature.

I am also quite secular in my beliefs. I don't really subscribe to any particular religion, but I do believe in the importance of being a good person. I try to live my life in a way that is benevolent and ethical, and I hope that others will do the same.

Unfortunately, I am also quite pessimistic by nature. I often see the negative potential in every situation and I am quick to point out the potential problems that could arise. This can be frustrating for those around me, but it is just the way I am.

 I am also moderately gullible. I tend to believe what others tell me, even if there is no evidence to support their claims. This can sometimes led to me being taken advantage of, but I generally trust that people are good.

I can also be quite vengeful if I feel like I have been wronged. If someone does something to hurt me or my loved ones, I will endeavor to make them pay for their actions. This can sometimes lead to me acting in ways that I later regret, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite lazy. I often find myself wanting to just relax and do nothing, especially if I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed. This can sometimes lead to me procrastinating or avoiding my responsibilities, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite introverted. I generally prefer to spend time alone or with just a few close friends, rather than large groups of people. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as aloof or uncaring, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite playful. I like to joke around and have fun, even in the most challenging of situations. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as childish or immature, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite stubborn. Once I have made up my mind about something, it is very difficult to change my opinion. This can sometimes lead to me being inflexible or unyielding, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite thoughtful. I like to think about things carefully and I am often ( although not always) able to see both sides of every issue. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as indecisive or unprincipled, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite progressive in my thinking. I am always open to new ideas and I am willing to consider different points of view. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as na√Øve or disrespectful, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite activist in my thinking. I am always looking for ways to make the world a better place and I am often involved in political and social causes. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as self-righteous or disruptive, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite egalitarian in my thinking. I believe that everyone should be treated equally and I am often vocally critical of discrimination in all its forms. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as strident or difficult, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite anxious. I often worry about things that might happen, even if there is no evidence to support my fears. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as anxious or nervous, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite vain. I like to look my best and I often spend a lot of time and money on my appearance. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as superficial or shallow, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite violent. I often resort to violence when I am feeling threatened or when I am trying to protect myself or my loved ones. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as aggressive or dangerous, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite emotionally sensitive. I often feel things very deeply and I am quick to tears. This can sometimes lead to me being seen as weak or overly emotional, but it is just the way I am.

I am also quite healthy. I generally take care of myself and I
