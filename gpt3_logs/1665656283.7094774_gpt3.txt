I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am extremely concerned about this proposed bill. As someone who is pro-choice, I believe that a woman should have the right to choose what happens to her own body. Banning abortion under all circumstances would be a disaster for women all over the country.

There are many material consequences that would come from this bill being passed. First and foremost, it would take away a woman's right to control her own body. This would be a violation of her human rights. Additionally, it would force women to have children that they may not be able to care for, which could lead to a whole host of other problems.

This bill would also have a negative impact on the economy. According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, bans on abortion lead to an increase in poverty. This is because women who are unable to get abortions are more likely to drop out of school and lose their jobs. This, in turn, leads to them being unable to provide for their families.

Furthermore, this bill would have a negative impact on public health. According to the World Health Organization, unsafe abortions are a leading cause of death and injury for women all over the world. If this bill were to be passed, it would likely lead to an increase in the number of unsafe abortions, as women would be desperate to end their pregnancies.

All in all, I believe that this bill is a terrible idea. It would have a negative impact on the lives of women all over the country, and I urge my representatives to vote against it.
