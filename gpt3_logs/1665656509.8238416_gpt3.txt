I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born into a wealthy family in the Sub-Saharan African country of Liberia. My parents were extremely traditional and wanted their children to be raised in the same way that they had been. As a result, I was sent to private schools and received a very well-rounded education. Unfortunately, my country was ravaged by a civil war when I was a teenager and my family was forced to flee to the United States.

Starting over in a new country was extremely difficult, but I was determined to make the best of it. I finished high school and then went on to receive my postsecondary education. I graduated with honors and was lucky enough to land a job in the installation, maintenance, and repair industry. I currently work for a very large company and enjoy my job.

In addition to my regular job, I am also progressive activist. I believe strongly in equality for all people, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation. I am an active member of the LGBTQ community and am constantly working to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.

Despite the challenges I have faced in my life, I remain optimistic and upbeat. I believe that all people have the potential to be good and that we all have the power to make the world a better place.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

hello, if this bill were to past it would have some major consequences for not just the the women in this country, but everyone. Here are some things to consider: 

-It would criminalize something that is currently not criminal. This would lead to more incarceration, specifically of low-income women and women of color.

-It would force women to continue pregnancies that they may not be physically or mentally able to handle. This could lead to increased rates of maternal mortality and morbidity.

-It would take away a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. This would strip away her autonomy and her ability to control her own life.

These are just a few of the potential consequences of this bill. It's important to think about all of the people that would be affected by it before making a decision. Thank you for your time.
