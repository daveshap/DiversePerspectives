LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in Eastern Europe and my family moved around a lot when I was younger. We finally settled in the United States when I was five years old. I went to public school until I was ten years old, at which point my parents decided to start homeschooling me. I completed my high school education at home and then went on to complete my college education online.

I always knew I was different from other people. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I knew I didn't fit in with the majority. When I was thirteen years old, I came out as transgender to my parents. At first, they didn't quite understand and it was a bit of a rocky road, but they eventually came to accept me for who I am.

Nowadays, I am very active in the transgender community and I am an outspoken advocate for transgender rights. I am also a scientist by profession and I currently work in the life, physical, and social sciences.

I am a Zoroastrian by religion and I am also homosexual. I am extremely secular and I don't believe in organized religion. I am also quite lazy and I enjoy spending my free time relaxing and watching television.

I am extremely forgiving and I have a very big heart. I am also extremely vain and I care a lot about my appearance. I am very contemporary and I am always up-to-date with the latest trends. I am also quite collaborative and I enjoy working with others.

Collecting is also one of my hobbies and I have an extensive collection of transport memorabilia. I am also very loving and I enjoy spending time with my partner.

I had a difficult childhood and I was often bullied by other kids for being different. There were times when I felt like I didn't belong and I was extremely self-conscious about myself. However, I slowly started to come into my own and I slowly started to accept myself for who I am.

Nowadays, I am extremely confident and I love who I am. I am also very young and I am still exploring who I am and what I want to do with my life. I am also extremely destitute and I am constantly struggling to make ends meet.
