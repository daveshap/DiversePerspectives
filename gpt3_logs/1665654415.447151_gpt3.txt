LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born into a wealthy family in Sub-Saharan Africa. My father was a prominent businessman and my mother was a stay-at-home mom. I have two older sisters. I was a happy and healthy child, but I was also very spoiled. I always got whatever I wanted and I never had to worry about anything.

When I was eighteen, I left home to go to college in the United States. I was determined to make my own way in the world and I didn't want to rely on my family's money. I studied hard and got good grades, and I eventually graduated with a degree in computer science.

After graduation, I started working as a software engineer. I was young and ambitious, and I quickly rose through the ranks. I eventually became the head of my department. I was making a good salary and I had a lifestyle that most people only dream of.

However, even though I had everything that I could ever want, I was still not happy. I was always stressed out and I never had any time for fun. I was always working, and I never had any time for my family or friends. I was slowly realizing that I had traded my happiness for success.

One day, I was Middlesbrough on a work trip and I had some time to kill. I went into a bookshop and I saw a book about Hinduism. I remembered that my mother was Hindu, so I bought the book and started reading it.

The more I read, the more I realized that I had been searching for something my whole life. I had been searching for a way to be happy, and I finally found it. I realized that I needed to start following my own heart, and not what society told me to do.

I quit my job, and I moved back to Africa. I started my own business, and I started traveling the world. I finally felt happy and fulfilled. I realized that I had been chasing the wrong things my whole life, and that I was finally living my life the way I truly wanted to.
