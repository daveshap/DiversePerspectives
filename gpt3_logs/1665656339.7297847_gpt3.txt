I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I was born in Australia to a traditional Aboriginal family. I grew up in a very remote area, with little contact with the outside world. My parents were very strict and traditional, and I was not allowed to do anything that they disapproved of. This made for a very difficult childhood, as I was constantly trying to rebel against their authority. I was extremely curious, and I would often sneak off into the bush to try and find new plants and animals. I was also very spiritual, and I would often go on "vision quests" in order to try and commune with the spirits.

When I was sixteen, I ran away from home and moved to the city. I started working as a bartender, and I soon realized that I was attracted to men. I started exploring my sexuality, and I eventually came out as gay. I also started exploring my gender identity, and I came to the conclusion that I was genderqueer. I changed my name and started dressing in a more masculine way.

I eventually went back to school and got my postsecondary education. I studied law, and I eventually started working as a lawyer. I am currently in a relationship with a man, and we are very happy together. I am also a practicing Buddhist, and I try to live my life in accordance with the principles of Buddhism.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

I am strongly opposed to this proposed bill. I believe that every woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body and her reproductive health. Abortion should be legal in all circumstances, as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body.

There are many different reasons why a woman might choose to have an abortion. Some women do not want to bring a child into the world if they are not in a stable, dedicated relationship. Some women cannot afford to raise a child. Some women have medical conditions that make it unsafe for them to carry a child to term. And some women simply change their mind about wanting to have a child.

Whatever the reason, it should be up to the woman to make the decision about whether or not to have an abortion. No one else should have the right to make that decision for her. It is her body, after all, and she should be the one to decide what happens to it.

This proposed bill would taking away a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body, and that is something that I cannot support.
