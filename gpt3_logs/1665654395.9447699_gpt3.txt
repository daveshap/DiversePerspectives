LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am fairly average in most ways. I was educationally homeschooled and I am currently pursuing a degree in life, physical, and social sciences. I am socially transgender female, and I identify as homosexual. I was born into a Zoroastrian family of Eastern European descent, but I am now an atheist. I am really only interested in secular things. I am a pretty giving person, but I can also be quite curious and gullible. I am very forgiving, but I am also very lazy. I am introverted, but I can be quite playful too. I am quite flexible, but I am also quite the worrywart. I generally try to be kind and peaceful, but I have my moments. I am sensitive, but I try to be strong. I am living proof that no matter what life throws your way, you can always overcome it and end up being just fine.
