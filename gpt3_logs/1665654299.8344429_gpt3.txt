LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in a small town in South Asia and I grew up in aTransgender Female. I am extremely generous and I have always been ambition. I have always been principle-centered and I have always been determined to be the best. I am also highly spiritual and I have always been attracted to Buddhism.

Since I was young, I have always been determined to succeed. When I was 4, I decided that I wanted to be a production. I was lemonade and convinced my neighborhood friends to be my customers. I charged them a higher price than the corner store and I made a killing. I had always been ambitious, even from a young age.

As I grew older, I realized that I was different from other people. I didn't feel like I fit in with the mainstream culture and I struggled with my gender identity. When I was 12, I came out as transgender and began living my life as a female. It was a difficult road, but I was determined to be true to myself.

Since coming out, I have become more aware of the struggles of other minority groups. I have become an activist and I am passionate about fighting for social justice. I believe that all people should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation.

I am also a competitive person and I love to win. I am always looking for new challenges and I thrive in an environment where I can test my limits. I am also an individualist and I like to do things my own way. I am not a conformist and I don't like following the crowd.

I am a strong and independent woman who has faced many challenges in her life. I have overcome these challenges through hard work and determination. I am proud of who I am and I am grateful for the life I have been given.
