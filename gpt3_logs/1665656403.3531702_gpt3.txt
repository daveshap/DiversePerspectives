I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere. There was not much to do there, so I mostly just stayed inside and read books. I was always an extremely curious person, and I loved learning about new things. I was also very introverted, and I only had a handful of close friends.

When I was sixteen, I stumbled upon a book about transgender people and their experiences. It was the first time I had ever heard of such a thing, and I was immediately fascinated. I read the book from cover to cover, and it completely changed my view of the world. I realized that there was a whole other world out there that I had never even known existed.

After that, I started doing a lot of research on transgender people and their experiences. I read everything I could get my hands on, and I eventually realized that I was transgender myself. Once I realized that, my whole world changed. I no longer felt like I was just an outsider looking in on the world; I felt like I belonged somewhere.

Since coming out as transgender, my life has been a lot more difficult. I have faced a lot of discrimination and transphobia, both from strangers and from people who are close to me. It hasn't been easy, but I am slowly learning to love and accept myself for who I am.

I am still the same curious person I always was, and I continue to love learning about new things. These days, my interests have shifted to focus more on transgender rights and issues. I am extremely passionate about fighting for the rights of transgender people, and I hope to one day make a difference in the world.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am extremely concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. If this bill were to pass, it would have a devastating impact on the lives of women and transgender people.

There are many transgender people who rely on abortion in order to transition. Without access to abortion, they would be forced to continue living in a body that does not align with their true identity. This would be immensely damaging to their mental and physical health.

In addition, the ban on all abortions would force many women to continue pregnancies that they are not ready for, both physically and emotionally. This would lead to an increase in maternal mortality rates, as well as a decrease in the overall health of women.

I believe that everyone has the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. Banning all abortions under all circumstances would take away this fundamental right, and it would have a hugely negative impact on the lives of women and transgender people.
