I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

As someone who is pro-choice, I have serious concerns about a proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a number of negative consequences for both women and society as a whole.

Firstly, banning abortions would not stop them from happening. Women will still seek out ways to have abortions, even if it means putting their own lives at risk. This was the case before abortion was legal, and it would be the case again if it were to be banned.

Secondly, banning abortions would disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color. These women would be more likely to turn to dangerous and illegal methods of abortion, or to be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.

Thirdly, banning abortion would take away a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Every woman should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, and no one else should be able to make that decision for her.

Fourthly, a ban on abortion would lead to more unintended pregnancies. If women are not able to access safe and legal abortions, they may be more likely to resort to risky behaviors in an attempt to self-abort. This would lead to more unintended pregnancies, and ultimately to more abortions.

Ultimately, I believe that banning abortion would do more harm than good. It would not stop abortions from happening, and it would have a negative impact on women, low-income individuals, and people of color. It would also infringe on a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. For these reasons, I oppose any bill that would ban abortions under all circumstances.
