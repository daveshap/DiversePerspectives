LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am a young, gay man of Mediterranean descent. I was born into a traditional family, but my parents divorced when I was young. As a result, I had a difficult childhood. I was raised by my mother and stepfather, who was a humanist. I was educated in the public school system and then went on to receive my postsecondary education.

I am now a legal professional. I work in a progressive, activist law firm that is very inclusive and egalitarian. I am very proud of the work that we do to help people who have been marginalized and discriminated against.

I am extremely generous, kind, and sensitive. I care deeply about social justice and making the world a better place for everyone. I am also very anxious and often find myself feeling overwhelmed. However, I am extremely resilient and have always been able to overcome whatever challenges life has thrown my way.
