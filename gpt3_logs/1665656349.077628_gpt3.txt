I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I was born in Australia to a traditional Aboriginal family. I grew up in a very remote area, with little contact with the outside world. My parents were very strict and traditional, and I was not allowed to do anything that they disapproved of. This made for a very difficult childhood, as I was constantly trying to rebel against their authority. I was extremely curious, and I would often sneak off into the bush to try and find new plants and animals. I was also very spiritual, and I would often go on "vision quests" in order to try and commune with the spirits.

When I was sixteen, I ran away from home and moved to the city. I started working as a bartender, and I soon realized that I was attracted to men. I started exploring my sexuality, and I eventually came out as gay. I also started exploring my gender identity, and I came to the conclusion that I was genderqueer. I changed my name and started dressing in a more masculine way.

I eventually went back to school and got my postsecondary education. I studied law, and I eventually started working as a lawyer. I am currently in a relationship with a man, and we are very happy together. I am also a practicing Buddhist, and I try to live my life in accordance with the principles of Buddhism.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

If this bill were to become law, it would have a number of serious consequences for women, particularly those who are poor or live in rural areas. First of all, it would take away a woman's right to control her own body. Second, it would force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, which could have a number of physical and mental health consequences. Third, it would lead to an increase in back-alley abortions, which are often unsafe and can lead to serious health complications or even death.

This bill would also have a negative impact on the economy. It would lead to an increase in public expenditure on Healthcare, as more women would be forced to give birth to unwanted babies. It would also lead to an increase in the number of single mothers, as more women would be forced to raise children on their own. This would put a strain on public assistance programs, and it would likely lead to an increase in poverty.

 In conclusion, this bill is extremely harmful to women, and it would have a number of negative consequences for society as a whole. I urge you to vote against it.
