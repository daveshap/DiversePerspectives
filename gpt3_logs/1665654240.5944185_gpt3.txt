LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am the product of a mixed-race marriage. My father is Australian and my mother is of mixed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. I was born in Australia and have always considered myself to be Australian. However, I am also proud of my Aboriginal heritage and am a member of the Aboriginal community.

I had a difficult childhood. My parents divorced when I was young and my father was an absentee father. My mother struggled to support my brother and me emotionally and financially. As a result, I was a shy and introverted child. I had low self-esteem and was often the target of bullying.

Despite the challenges I faced during my childhood, I was determined to succeed. I worked hard in school and achieved good grades. I was also lucky to have a few close friends who supported me during this difficult time.

After finishing high school, I decided to study law. I was drawn to the subject because I wanted to help people who had been treated unfairly. I also thought that it would be a good way to make a difference in the world.

I have now been working as a lawyer for several years. I am still shy and introverted, but I have learned to deal with it. I am also very analytical and critical, which enhances my ability to see both sides of every issue.

My experiences have shaped who I am today. I am a strong and resilient person. I am also compassionate and caring. I am proud of my Aboriginal heritage and am determined to make a difference in the world.
