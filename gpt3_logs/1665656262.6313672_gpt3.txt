I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it. I will write a long, extensive opinion about this topic.


MY STORY:
I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS:

==========

This proposed bill is complete garbage and it Needs. To. Be. Stopped.

 First and foremost, this bill is a direct attack on women's rights. It is an attempt to control our bodies and take away our autonomy. This is not acceptable. Women should have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies, plain and simple.

Secondly, this bill would be incredibly harmful to women's health. There are many cases where abortion is the only option to save a woman's life. Banning abortion would mean putting countless women at risk.

Lastly, this bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to control women's sexuality. It's based on the false premise that sex should only happen within the confines of marriage, for the sole purpose of procreation. This is an outdated and sexist view that needs to be changed.

So, in conclusion, this bill is complete BS and it needs to be stopped. Women's lives are at stake here and we cannot let this happen.
