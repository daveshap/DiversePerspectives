LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I am the person who is always looking for answers. I want to know why things happen the way they do and I'm always looking for ways to improve things. I'm curious about everything and I tend to be very critical. I'm also very flexible and adaptable, which has served me well in my career. I'm a lawyer by profession and I've always been very ambitious. I'm also quite introverted and I don't always feel comfortable in social situations. That said, I can be very playful and I enjoy making others laugh.

I had a difficult childhood. I was born into a very traditional family and I was expected to follow in my father's footsteps. But I was different. I was never interested in the things that my father was interested in and I always felt like I was living in his shadow. Worse still, I was attracted to men, which was something that my father could not accept. I spent a lot of my childhood feeling ostracized and alone.

When I was 18, I finally left home and I made my way to the city. It was there that I found myself and I began to build a life for myself. I met other gay men and I started to explore my sexuality. I also started to stand up for myself and I began to fight for equality. I quickly realized that I was very passionate about social justice and I became an activist. I also decided to go to law school so that I could use my knowledge to help others.

Today, I am a successful lawyer and I continue to fight for the rights of others. I am also very Loving person. I have a partner and we have been together for many years. We have a beautiful home and a wonderful life together. I am happy and content with who I am and I am proud of the person that I have become.
