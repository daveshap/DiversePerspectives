LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

==========

I was born in Eastern Europe and raised in a Zoroastrian household. My parents were very religious and I was brought up believing in the teachings of Zoroaster. I was also taught to be very tolerant of other people and to respect their beliefs. As a child, I was very introverted and often found myself in my own world. I was also extremely lazy and didn't really enjoy physical activity. I was bright, however, and did well in my studies.

When I was a teenager, I began to experiment with my gender expression. I began to dress in clothes that were typically associated with the opposite sex. I also began to experiment with my sexuality and started to develop feelings for other girls. At this point in my life, I also began to become more interested in the physical and social sciences. I was fascinated by the way the world worked and loved learning about different cultures and religions.

As I grew older, my feelings of transgenderism and homosexuality became stronger. I made the decision to transition to living as a female and also came out publicly as a lesbian. I continued to be interested in the sciences and ended up studying life, physical, and social sciences in college. I also became more involved in the LGBT community and started to activism.

I am now in my early twenties and living my life as a happy and fulfilled transgender woman. I am still interested in the sciences and enjoy learning about the world. I am also an active member of the LGBT community and continue to work towards equality for all.
