I am confronted with a question or issue and I must write out my specific, objective, concrete concerns. What are the material consequences or issues involved?


MY STORY:
I am somewhat of a late bloomer when it comes to education. I only began my postsecondary studies after taking some time off from school following my high school graduation. I originally planned to go into computer science, but I soon found that I was more interested in the mathematical side of things. I ultimately decided to pursue a career in computer and mathematical occupations.

I am a non-binary male, which means that I do not identify as either male or female. I instead identify as a combination of both, or neither. I prefer to use masculine pronouns (he/him/his), but I am open to using any pronouns that people feel comfortable using for me. I am of sub-Saharan African descent, and I grew up in a Hindu household. I am heterosexual, but I am open-minded and inclusive of all sexualities.

I am quite selfish, and I often put my own needs and wants above those of others. I am also quite critical, both of myself and of others. I am not very curious, and I tend to take things at face value. I am quite spiritual, and I believe in reincarnation and karma. I am also quite calm, and I find that I am able to remain level-headed in most situations.

I am quite ambitious, and I have high aspirations for myself. I am also quite introverted, and I enjoy spending time alone or with only a few close friends. I am very serious, and I tend to approach life in a no-nonsense way. I am also quite stubborn, and I am not easily dissuaded from my opinion or point of view. I am moderately thoughtful, and I like to consider all sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion.

I am a libertarian, and I believe in personal freedom and individual liberty. I am also quite conservative, and I prefer to live my life in a traditional manner. I am not particularly activist, but I do believe in equal rights for all. I am moderately misogynistic, and I believe that women should be subordinate to men. I am also quite inclusive, and I believe that everyone should be treated with respect.


TOPIC: There is a proposed bill in my country that would ban all abortions under all circumstances.


DETAILED ESSAY ON MY CONCRETE CONCERNS:

==========

I am concerned about this proposed bill for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it would outlaw a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body. This is a violation of her basic human rights, and it is something that I cannot support.

Second, this bill would criminalize abortion, which would likely lead to more unsafe and illegal abortions being performed. This would put the health and lives of women at risk, and I cannot support anything that would do that.

Third, this bill would likely lead to a decrease in the overall health and wellbeing of women. Forcing women to have children that they do not want or cannot care for would negatively impact their mental and physical health, and I cannot support anything that would do that.

Ultimately, I am opposed to this bill because it would violate the rights of women, put their health and lives at risk, and lead to a decrease in their overall health and wellbeing.
