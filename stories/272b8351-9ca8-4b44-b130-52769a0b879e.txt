I am somewhat of a late bloomer when it comes to education. I only began my postsecondary studies after taking some time off from school following my high school graduation. I originally planned to go into computer science, but I soon found that I was more interested in the mathematical side of things. I ultimately decided to pursue a career in computer and mathematical occupations.

I am a non-binary male, which means that I do not identify as either male or female. I instead identify as a combination of both, or neither. I prefer to use masculine pronouns (he/him/his), but I am open to using any pronouns that people feel comfortable using for me. I am of sub-Saharan African descent, and I grew up in a Hindu household. I am heterosexual, but I am open-minded and inclusive of all sexualities.

I am quite selfish, and I often put my own needs and wants above those of others. I am also quite critical, both of myself and of others. I am not very curious, and I tend to take things at face value. I am quite spiritual, and I believe in reincarnation and karma. I am also quite calm, and I find that I am able to remain level-headed in most situations.

I am quite ambitious, and I have high aspirations for myself. I am also quite introverted, and I enjoy spending time alone or with only a few close friends. I am very serious, and I tend to approach life in a no-nonsense way. I am also quite stubborn, and I am not easily dissuaded from my opinion or point of view. I am moderately thoughtful, and I like to consider all sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion.

I am a libertarian, and I believe in personal freedom and individual liberty. I am also quite conservative, and I prefer to live my life in a traditional manner. I am not particularly activist, but I do believe in equal rights for all. I am moderately misogynistic, and I believe that women should be subordinate to men. I am also quite inclusive, and I believe that everyone should be treated with respect.
