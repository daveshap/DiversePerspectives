I never really had what you might call a "normal" childhood. For starters, I was homeschooled by my parents until I was 18. This meant that I didn't have the chance to interact with other kids my age on a regular basis, so I was always a little bit behind socially. It also meant that I was never really exposed to a lot of different things and I was pretty sheltered. I think that looking back on it now, it wasn't the best situation for me, but it didn't really bother me all that much at the time.

Eventually, I started to become more aware of my sexuality and realized that I was a lesbian. This was a big deal for me because I had always been raised in a very conservative, religious household. My parents were (and still are) very religious Zoroastrians, so learning that I was gay was a huge shock to them. It was a difficult time for all of us, but we eventually got through it and now things are much better between us.

Since coming out, I have been much more open and accepting of myself. I started to embrace my femininity and began to transition a few years ago. It's been a long and difficult journey, but it's been worth it. I am now living my life as my true self and I couldn't be happier.

I currently work as a life, physical, and social science researcher. I really enjoy my job and I feel like I'm making a difference in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading, and practicing yoga. I am also a big advocate for LGBTQ rights and strive to be a voice for my community.
