I am an Indian national and I grew up in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. I am the youngest of three siblings. My father is a businessman and my mother is a homemaker. I attended a Catholic school till eighth grade and then completed my high school at a government school. I graduated from college with a degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry. I worked as a desk clerk at a hotel for a year before getting a job as an English teacher at a school. I taught for two years and then I decided to pursue a Masters in Education. I completed my Master's degree and started working as a guidance counsellor at a school. I also started working as a freelance writer during this time. I wrote articles for magazines and newspapers on various topics.

I have always been interested in writing and I have been writing stories since I was a child. When I was in high school, I used to write short stories and submit them to competitions. I never won any of those competitions but that didn't discourage me from writing. I continued writing and eventually started getting publishing offers. I have published two books so far, one of short stories and the other a novel. I am currently working on my third book, a collection of essays.

I have always been a very curious person and I like to learn new things. I am always exploring new hobbies andinterests. I have a very active social life and I love spending time with my friends. I am also very competitive and I like to be the best at everything I do. I am extremely collectivist and I believe that we are all in this together. We are all connected and we should help each other. I am also extremely inclusive and I believe that everyone should be given the same opportunities regardless of their background or identity.
