I was born in a small town in North Africa and grew up in a large family. I had a difficult childhood, as my parents were both alcoholics and we were very poor. I was often malnourished and went without medical care. Despite all of this, I was a happy child who loved to play and explore the world around me.

I was always interested in the sciences, and when I was old enough, I started working in a lab. I loved the work and was soon promoted to a position where I was responsible for conducting experiments and analyzing data. I worked in the lab for many years, and it was during this time that I developed a deep interest in Islam.

I eventually left the lab to pursue a career in teaching. I wanted to share my love of science with others, and I believed that I could make a difference in the lives of my students. I taught for several years, and during this time, I also became more involved in my religion. I began attending Mosque regularly, and I started to wear a hijab.

After a few years, I started to feel like I was not making the impact I wanted to make in my students' lives. I decided to go back to school to get a degree in counseling. I thought that counseling would allow me to help my students in a more meaningful way.

I am now a counselor and I work with students who have been through similar experiences to what I went through as a child. I help them to understand their feelings and to make positive changes in their lives. I feel privileged to be able to help others in this way, and I hope to continue to make a difference in the lives of my students.
