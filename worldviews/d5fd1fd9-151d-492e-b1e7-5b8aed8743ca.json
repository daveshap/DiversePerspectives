 "story": "I am an Indian national and I grew up in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu. I am the youngest of three siblings. My father is a businessman and my mother is a homemaker. I attended a Catholic school till eighth grade and then completed my high school at a government school. I graduated from college with a degree in Biology and a minor in Chemistry. I worked as a desk clerk at a hotel for a year before getting a job as an English teacher at a school. I taught for two years and then I decided to pursue a Masters in Education. I completed my Master's degree and started working as a guidance counsellor at a school. I also started working as a freelance writer during this time. I wrote articles for magazines and newspapers on various topics.\n\nI have always been interested in writing and I have been writing stories since I was a child. When I was in high school, I used to write short stories and submit them to competitions. I never won any of those competitions but that didn't discourage me from writing. I continued writing and eventually started getting publishing offers. I have published two books so far, one of short stories and the other a novel. I am currently working on my third book, a collection of essays.\n\nI have always been a very curious person and I like to learn new things. I am always exploring new hobbies andinterests. I have a very active social life and I love spending time with my friends. I am also very competitive and I like to be the best at everything I do. I am extremely collectivist and I believe that we are all in this together. We are all connected and we should help each other. I am also extremely inclusive and I believe that everyone should be given the same opportunities regardless of their background or identity.",

   "compromises": "If this bill is passed, it would have a massive negative impact on women's lives. It would criminalize abortion, and punitive measures would be put in place against women who have them. This would lead to a host of problems, including an increase in illegal and unsafe abortions, and a decrease in overall women's health. Additionally, it would disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color, who would be less likely to have access to safe and legal abortion services. It would also further limiting women's reproductive autonomy and choice.\n\nThis bill is thus radically anti-woman, and would have a disastrous impact on women's lives if it is passed. I urge you to do everything in your power to stop it from becoming law.",
   "concerns": "I am extremely concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a very negative impact on women's lives. It would take away their right to make decisions about their own bodies and their own lives. It would also lead to more unwanted pregnancies, which would in turn lead to more health risks for women. Additionally, this bill would likely result in more illegal abortions, which would be even more dangerous for women. I believe that this bill is a step in the wrong direction and I urge my country to reject it.",
   "feelings": "I am pro-choice. I believe that a woman should have the right to choose what happens to her own body. I believe that every woman has the right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.\n\nI believe that the decision to have an abortion should be between a woman and her doctor. I believe that the government should not interfere in this decision. I believe that banning abortion is a step backwards. It is a violation of women's rights.\n\nI believe that abortion should be safe and legal. I believe that it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. I believe that a woman should be able to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.\n\nI believe that banning abortion is a violation of women's rights. It is a step backwards. It creates an unsafe environment for women. It forces women to take desperate measures to get abortions, which can often be unsafe.\n\nI believe that the decision to have an abortion should be between a woman and her doctor. I believe that the government should not interfere in this decision. I believe that women have a right to make their own decisions about their reproductive health.",
