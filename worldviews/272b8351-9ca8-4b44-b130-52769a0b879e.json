 "story": "I am somewhat of a late bloomer when it comes to education. I only began my postsecondary studies after taking some time off from school following my high school graduation. I originally planned to go into computer science, but I soon found that I was more interested in the mathematical side of things. I ultimately decided to pursue a career in computer and mathematical occupations.\n\nI am a non-binary male, which means that I do not identify as either male or female. I instead identify as a combination of both, or neither. I prefer to use masculine pronouns (he/him/his), but I am open to using any pronouns that people feel comfortable using for me. I am of sub-Saharan African descent, and I grew up in a Hindu household. I am heterosexual, but I am open-minded and inclusive of all sexualities.\n\nI am quite selfish, and I often put my own needs and wants above those of others. I am also quite critical, both of myself and of others. I am not very curious, and I tend to take things at face value. I am quite spiritual, and I believe in reincarnation and karma. I am also quite calm, and I find that I am able to remain level-headed in most situations.\n\nI am quite ambitious, and I have high aspirations for myself. I am also quite introverted, and I enjoy spending time alone or with only a few close friends. I am very serious, and I tend to approach life in a no-nonsense way. I am also quite stubborn, and I am not easily dissuaded from my opinion or point of view. I am moderately thoughtful, and I like to consider all sides of an issue before coming to a conclusion.\n\nI am a libertarian, and I believe in personal freedom and individual liberty. I am also quite conservative, and I prefer to live my life in a traditional manner. I am not particularly activist, but I do believe in equal rights for all. I am moderately misogynistic, and I believe that women should be subordinate to men. I am also quite inclusive, and I believe that everyone should be treated with respect.",

   "compromises": "I am concerned about this proposed bill for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it would outlaw a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body. This is a violation of her basic human rights, and it is something that I cannot support.\n\nSecond, this bill would criminalize abortion, which would likely lead to more unsafe and illegal abortions being performed. This would put the health and lives of women at risk, and I cannot support anything that would do that.\n\nThird, this bill would likely lead to a decrease in the overall health and wellbeing of women. Forcing women to have children that they do not want or cannot care for would negatively impact their mental and physical health, and I cannot support anything that would do that.\n\nUltimately, I am opposed to this bill because it would violate the rights of women, put their health and lives at risk, and lead to a decrease in their overall health and wellbeing.",
   "concerns": "I am concerned that this bill would have a number of material consequences, including:\n\n1) An increase in the number of unsafe, illegal abortions, as women would be forced to seek out clandestine services in order to terminated their pregnancies;\n\n2) An increase in maternal mortality, as women who are unable to obtain safe, legal abortions would be at greater risk of complications;\n\n3) An increase in the number of children born into poverty or difficult circumstances, as women who are forced to carry to term may not be able to provide for their child;\n\n4) A decrease in women's autonomy and control over their own bodies, as they would be forced to continue pregnancies that they may not want or be able to care for;\n\n5) A general feeling of oppression and subordination among women, as they would be denied a fundamental right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.",
   "feelings": "I am conflicted on the issue of abortion. On one hand, I believe that it is a woman's right to choose what to do with her body. On the other hand, I believe that all life is sacred and that abortion is taking a life. I can see arguments for both sides, and I can understand why people feel strongly about this issue.\n\n Personally, I believe that abortion should be legal in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. I do not believe that abortion should be used as a form of birth control, but I do understand that there are sometimes extenuating circumstances. I believe that each case should be considered individually, and that a decision should be made based on the individual circumstances.\n\nI understand that this is a sensitive and emotional issue, and I respect the opinions of those who disagree with me. I believe that this is a decision that should be made by the woman and her doctor, without interference from the government. I believe that women should have the right to make their own health care decisions, and that they should be able to access safe and legal abortions if they so choose.",
