 "story": "I was born in the year 2000, in the months following the dot com crash. My parents had been successful in the industry, but like many others, they too were forced to readjust to a new reality. We moved from the big city to a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a massive culture shock for all of us, but my parents made the best of it.\n\nI was a very tomboyish child and loved to play in the dirt and climb trees. I was also extremely enamored with all things related to computers, video games, and technology. I possibly could have become some sort of child prodigy if given the opportunity, but alas, we were living in the middle of nowhere and the nearest specialized school was a six hour drive away. So, I became a bit of a self-taught computer nerd.\n\nFortunately, my parents were incredibly supportive and encouraged my interests. As I got a bit older, we started going into the city on weekends so I could attend game design and coding workshops. I also started going to conventions and meeting people who shared my interests. It was through these experiences that I realized that I was transgender.\n\nComing out as transgender was a very difficult process. I was fortunate enough to have accepting and loving parents, but I worried about how the rest of the world would react. I knew that I would have to make some major changes in my life, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for that. But, with the support of my family and friends, I took the plunge and began my transition.\n\nIt hasn't been easy, but I am finally starting to feel like myself. I look forward to continuing my journey and sharing my story with others who may be going through something similar.",

   "compromises": "I am extremely concerned about the potential implications of this bill. If it is passed, it would mean that women would no longer have the right to control their own bodies. This would have a massive impact on our lives and our health, both physically and mentally.\n\nAbortion is a medical procedure that can be extremely important for women's health. In some cases, it may be the only way to save a woman's life. Banning abortion would putwomen's lives at risk. Not to mention, it would also force many women to give birth to children that they are not mentally or emotionally prepared for.\n\nThis bill would also have a negative impact on our economy. Women who are not ready to have children would be forced to leave the workforce, leading to a decrease in productivity. In addition, the cost of raising a child is extremely high, and many families would not be able to afford it. This would put an immense amount of stress on society as a whole.\n\nThere are many other problems that would arise if this bill is passed, but these are some of the most pressing concerns that I have. This bill would have a detrimental impact on our lives, our health, and our economy. I urge our government to think carefully before voting on this bill.",
   "concerns": "I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this bill would have a detrimental effect on the lives of women and other pregnant individuals.\n\n Globally, it is estimated that around 42 million women have abortions each year. That works out to be around 115,000 abortions each day. Banning all abortions would only serve to increase the number of unsafe, unregulated abortions. This would put the lives of many women and other pregnant individuals at risk.\n\nFurthermore, banning all abortions would also have a negative impact on the economy. According to a study by the Guttmacher Institute, banning all abortions would cost the US economy $21.6 billion each year. This is due to the fact that many women would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, leading to an increase in the number of unplanned births.\n\nIt is clear that the proposed bill to ban all abortions under all circumstances would have a negative impact on society. I urge lawmakers to consider the implications of this bill before voting on it.",
   "feelings": "I am vehemently opposed to this proposed bill. Declaring all abortions illegal is a gross violation of women's rights. Women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and no one else should have the right to dictate what they can or cannot do.\n\nThis bill would not only affect women who need or want abortions, but also those who have been the victim of rape or incest. Forcing these women to carry their rapist's child to term is unbelievably cruel. No one should be forced to relive their trauma over and over again.\n\nNot to mention, making all abortions illegal would do nothing to stop them from happening. Women will still have abortions, but they will be forced to do so in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. This will lead to more injuries and deaths, not less.\n\nIf this bill becomes law, it will set women's rights back decades. We cannot let that happen. We must stand up and fight for our rights, before it's too late.",
