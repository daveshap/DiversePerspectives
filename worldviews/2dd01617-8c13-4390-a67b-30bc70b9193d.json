 "story": "I was born in Australia to a traditional Aboriginal family. I grew up in a very remote area, with little contact with the outside world. My parents were very strict and traditional, and I was not allowed to do anything that they disapproved of. This made for a very difficult childhood, as I was constantly trying to rebel against their authority. I was extremely curious, and I would often sneak off into the bush to try and find new plants and animals. I was also very spiritual, and I would often go on \"vision quests\" in order to try and commune with the spirits.\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I ran away from home and moved to the city. I started working as a bartender, and I soon realized that I was attracted to men. I started exploring my sexuality, and I eventually came out as gay. I also started exploring my gender identity, and I came to the conclusion that I was genderqueer. I changed my name and started dressing in a more masculine way.\n\nI eventually went back to school and got my postsecondary education. I studied law, and I eventually started working as a lawyer. I am currently in a relationship with a man, and we are very happy together. I am also a practicing Buddhist, and I try to live my life in accordance with the principles of Buddhism.",

   "compromises": "I am deeply concerned about the proposed bill to ban all abortions in my country. I believe that this bill would have a negative impact on the lives of women, especially those who are living in poverty or who have been victims of violence.\n\nAbortion is a medical procedure that is vital to the health of women. It allows women to control their own bodies, and it gives them the ability to make choices about their own health. This bill would take away that right, and it would force women to either go through with an unwanted pregnancy or to risk their lives by having an illegal abortion.\n\nThis bill would also have a devastating impact on the lives of women who have been victims of rape or incest. Forcing these women to carry their rapists' babies would be cruel and inhuman, and it would only serve to further trauma them.\n\nI urge the government to reject this bill, and to instead focus on ensuring that all women have access to safe and legal abortions.",
   "concerns": "If this bill were to become law, it would have a number of serious consequences for women, particularly those who are poor or live in rural areas. First of all, it would take away a woman's right to control her own body. Second, it would force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, which could have a number of physical and mental health consequences. Third, it would lead to an increase in back-alley abortions, which are often unsafe and can lead to serious health complications or even death.\n\nThis bill would also have a negative impact on the economy. It would lead to an increase in public expenditure on Healthcare, as more women would be forced to give birth to unwanted babies. It would also lead to an increase in the number of single mothers, as more women would be forced to raise children on their own. This would put a strain on public assistance programs, and it would likely lead to an increase in poverty.\n\n In conclusion, this bill is extremely harmful to women, and it would have a number of negative consequences for society as a whole. I urge you to vote against it.",
   "feelings": "I am strongly opposed to this proposed bill. I believe that every woman has the right to make her own decisions about her body and her reproductive health. Abortion should be legal in all circumstances, as it is a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body.\n\nThere are many different reasons why a woman might choose to have an abortion. Some women do not want to bring a child into the world if they are not in a stable, dedicated relationship. Some women cannot afford to raise a child. Some women have medical conditions that make it unsafe for them to carry a child to term. And some women simply change their mind about wanting to have a child.\n\nWhatever the reason, it should be up to the woman to make the decision about whether or not to have an abortion. No one else should have the right to make that decision for her. It is her body, after all, and she should be the one to decide what happens to it.\n\nThis proposed bill would taking away a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body, and that is something that I cannot support.",
