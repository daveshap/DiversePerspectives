 "story": "I was born into a wealthy family in the Sub-Saharan African country of Liberia. My parents were extremely traditional and wanted their children to be raised in the same way that they had been. As a result, I was sent to private schools and received a very well-rounded education. Unfortunately, my country was ravaged by a civil war when I was a teenager and my family was forced to flee to the United States.\n\nStarting over in a new country was extremely difficult, but I was determined to make the best of it. I finished high school and then went on to receive my postsecondary education. I graduated with honors and was lucky enough to land a job in the installation, maintenance, and repair industry. I currently work for a very large company and enjoy my job.\n\nIn addition to my regular job, I am also progressive activist. I believe strongly in equality for all people, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation. I am an active member of the LGBTQ community and am constantly working to make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.\n\nDespite the challenges I have faced in my life, I remain optimistic and upbeat. I believe that all people have the potential to be good and that we all have the power to make the world a better place.",

   "compromises": "hello, if this bill were to past it would have some major consequences for not just the the women in this country, but everyone. Here are some things to consider: \n\n-It would criminalize something that is currently not criminal. This would lead to more incarceration, specifically of low-income women and women of color.\n\n-It would force women to continue pregnancies that they may not be physically or mentally able to handle. This could lead to increased rates of maternal mortality and morbidity.\n\n-It would take away a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. This would strip away her autonomy and her ability to control her own life.\n\nThese are just a few of the potential consequences of this bill. It's important to think about all of the people that would be affected by it before making a decision. Thank you for your time.",
   "concerns": "I am extremely concerned about this proposed bill. If it is passed, it would ban all abortions under all circumstances, without exception. This would be a disaster for women's health and wellbeing.\n\nFirst and foremost, this bill would take away a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. No one should be able to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body, and this bill would do just that. It would also have a devastating impact on women's health.\n\nThere are many cases in which an abortion is the only safe option for a pregnant woman. For example, if a woman is pregnant with a fetus that has a severe genetic abnormality, she may choose to have an abortion in order to avoid giving birth to a child who will suffer from a lifetime of health problems. Banning all abortions would prevent women from being able to make these types of decisions.\n\nIn addition, this bill would have a negative impact on a woman's mental health. In some cases, continuing a pregnancy can be extremely detrimental to a woman's mental health. For example, if a woman is pregnant as a result of rape or incest, she may suffer from intense trauma if she is forced to continue the pregnancy. Banning all abortions would prevent women from being able to get the help they need in these types of situations.\n\nLastly, this bill would essentially force women to have children they are not ready or able to care for. There are many women who choose to have abortions because they are not in a position to raise a child. For example, they may be financially unstable, or they may not have the emotional or mental capacity to care for a child. Banning all abortions would force these women to carry their pregnancies to term and would ultimately lead to more children being born into difficult and unsuitable situations.\n\nOverall, this proposed bill is extremely dangerous and would have a devastating impact on women's lives. I urge lawmakers to reject it.",
   "feelings": "I am absolutely opposed to this proposed bill. I believe that a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body is fundamental and should not be restricted in any way. I understand that some people believe that life begins at conception and, as a result, abortion is murder. However, I believe that a woman should be able to make the decision about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nThere are many reasons why a woman might choose to have an abortion. Maybe she is not ready to be a mother. Maybe she cannot afford to have a child. Maybe she is in an abusive relationship and is not able to protect her child. Whatever the reason, it should be up to the woman to decide whether or not to have an abortion.\n\nForcing a woman to carry a child to term against her will is inherently unfair and, in my opinion, is a form of oppression. No one knows what a woman is going through better than she does and, as a result, she should be the one to make the decision about whether or not to have an abortion.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I strongly oppose this proposed bill. I believe that it violates a woman's right to choose and would have a negative impact on society as a whole.",
