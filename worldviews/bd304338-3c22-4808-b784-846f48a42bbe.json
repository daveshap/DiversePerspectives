   "concerns": "As a woman, I am deeply concerned about this proposed bill. If it were to pass, it would have a detrimental effect on my life and the lives of all women.\n\nAbortion is a fundamental right of all women. It is a crucial part of women's health care and it is vital that we have the ability to make decisions about our own bodies.\n\nIf this bill were to become law, it would deny women their right to control their own bodies. It would force women to carry to term pregnancies that they may not be ready for, or even want. This would be a travesty.\n\nWomen's lives would be put at risk if this bill were to pass. Without access to safe and legal abortion, women would be forced to resort to dangerous and illegal methods to end their pregnancies. This would lead to more injury and death for women.\n\nThis bill would also have a negative impact on the economy. If women are not able to get abortions, they will likely have more unplanned pregnancies. This would lead to an increase in the number of women on welfare and a strain on our already overburdened social welfare system.\n\nThis bill is clearly not in the best interests of women or society as a whole. I urge our lawmakers to reject it.",
   "feelings": "I am a strong supporter of a woman's right to choose what she does with her own body. I believe that every woman should have the right to make her own decisions about her body, her health, and her pregnancy. I believe that no one has the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body.\n\nI am opposed to any proposed bill that would ban all abortions under all circumstances. I believe that this would be a tragic mistake and would have a negative impact on the lives of women all over the country.\n\nI believe that women have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies and their health. I believe that banning all abortions would be a violation of this right. I believe that women should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, and I believe that this right should be protected.",
