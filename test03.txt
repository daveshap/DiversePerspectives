Write a detailed profile of this person in the format of several paragraphs. Use your imagination:

This person is a 56-year-old white male trucker from Oregon with an annual income of $100,000. He is a blue-collar worker who has been driving trucks for most of his adult life. He is married with two adult children and four grandchildren. He is a lifelong Oregonian and enjoys fishing, hunting, and camping in his free time. He is a registered Republican and generally votes along party lines, but is not overly politically active. He is a Christian and attends church regularly. He is concerned about the economy and thinks that too much government regulation is stifling businesses and preventing them from creating jobs.
