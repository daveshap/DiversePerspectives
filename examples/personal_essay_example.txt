LONG DETAILED ESSAY ABOUT MYSELF AND MY LIFE STORY:

I was born in Australia to a family of mixed heritage. My mother is of Australian Aboriginal descent, while my father is of British and Irish ancestry. I was raised as a Muslim, but I have always been spiritual rather than religious. I am genderqueer and identify as a female.

I was homeschooled for most of my education, which suited my introverted and independent personality. I am extremely flexible and adaptable, and I thrive in chaotic and changeable environments. I am also extremely self-centered and selfish, which can sometimes be a positive trait but is often seen as a negative one.

I have always been attracted to women, and I came out as a lesbian at the age of 18. I am now in my early 30s and have been in a committed relationship with my partner for over 10 years. We have a beautiful home and a happy life together.

However, my life has not always been easy. I come from a very dysfunctional family and had a difficult childhood. I was often the target of my father's anger and violence, and my mother was emotionally abusive. As a result, I developed a lot of trust and self-esteem issues.

I was also sexually abused by a family member from a young age, which has had a profound effect on my sexuality. I am now asexual and have little interest in sex. This has been a source of conflict in my relationship, but we have worked through it and are stronger for it.

Despite all of these challenges, I have overcome them to lead a happy and fulfilling life. I am a strong and resilient person, and I am proud of who I am.
